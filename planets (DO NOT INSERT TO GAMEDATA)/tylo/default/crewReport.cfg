		TyloInSpace = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
		TyloInSpace = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
		TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered than the other.
		TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there...
		TyloInSpace = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesnâ€™t have an atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity is quite heavy and reminds you of home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You can't walk a few meters without your face becoming friends with the surface. It is a little agitating.
		TyloSrfLanded = I was expecting a bounce in my step. Maybe my springs aren't working.
		TyloSrfLanded = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.
		TyloInSpaceLow = The crew wonders why they even need to land on this miserable rock.
