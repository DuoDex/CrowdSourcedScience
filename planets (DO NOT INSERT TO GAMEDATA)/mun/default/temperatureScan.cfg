		default = The thermometer is busy right now. If you'd like to request a temperature reading, please leave your number after the tone.
		default = It doesn't say if it's in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
		default = Of course we use Kelvin. Everything must start with K.
		default = The screen displaying temperature information is continuously showing bad temperature puns. You note this strange behavior and hope it's not something serious.
		default = You read the temperature from the store-bought thermometer with a few wires stuck to it.
		default = Collected and recorded temperature data from the environment.
		default = Hotter than you expected.
		default = Colder than expected.
		default = More average than you expected.
		default = Temperature readings are nominal.
		default = Temperature reads 98.6. Looks normal.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Temperature readings are, quite literally, nominal.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The temperature reading spikes suddenly. Did somebody start the engines?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The temperature rises as an angry Gene Kerman comes over the radio and demands to know what you’re still doing there.

		MinmusSrfLanded = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.
		SunInSpaceLow = The temperatures are off the chart. Check that, the chart just burned up. You wonder what it said...
		SunInSpaceLow = You look at the display and realize that you probably won't need the oven to heat your food.
		SunInSpaceLow = It's hot. What did you expect?
		SunInSpaceLow = You come to the shocking conclusion that temperature readings here are considerably high.
		SunInSpaceLow = The temperature is hard to read as the paint melts from the surface of the instrument.

		LaytheSrfLanded = It’s quite cold here. You would definitely need some warm clothes if you were ever to walk around without your spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Temperatures are similar to those of Kerbin’s polar regions. The water hasn’t frozen, though, most probably due to the high salinity.
		TyloSrfLanded = It reads cold until you realize that all of the liquid in the thermometer has just pooled at the bottom.
		BopSrfLanded = The thermometer reads 66.6 degrees Celsius. That...that can't be right.
		BopSrfLanded = Bop’s temperature seems highly suspect…
		BopSrfLanded = Bop is trying to mislead your temperature readings. Or maybe it’s not Bop, but something that lives on Bop?
		PolSrfLanded = The temperature varies from one rock formation to another. They must each conduct heat differently.
		PolSrfLanded = Scientists have confirmed that there is no temperature present on Pol.
		Eeloo = This far from the Sun, Eeloo's surface is barely affected by its radiation.
		Eeloo = Its cold, but you rub your hands together and think of home, and Moho.
		Eeloo = "COLD." Big surprise.

		EelooSrfLanded = The mercury seems to have retreated into the bulb at the bottom. You peck at the bulb several times, hoping for it to reemerge. Is it really that cold?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.
		VallInSpace = It's incredibly cold, but every now and then the temperature rises. Plumes of heat must be coming off the moon below.
		VallSrfLanded = There is a section below the surface that has a surprisingly high temperature for Vall. Being Vall, of course, it's still quite cold.
		VallSrfLanded = After scraping flecks of ice off the meter, you confirm that yes, it is indeed very cold out.
		TyloInSpace = Reflected light from Tylo doesn't appear to transfer much heat to the surrounding space.

		MohoInSpaceLow = This wasn't tested for such temperatures.
		MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN. One of the wires must have come loose again.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It's pretty cold here. You'd almost think Kerbol hadn't shined here crater since it was formed!
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The thermometer is shivering from the cold. With the high walls blocking all the sunlight, this is not surprising.
		MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The blackened rocks absorb and radiate large quantities of the Sun's heat. You briefly consider the idea of sunbathing, but realize you don't have a beach towel. Oh well...
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The long shadows cast by the crater rims make this region colder than the surrounding highlands.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The temperature reading fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
		MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh." You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The thermometer says the temperature is 7000, but refuses to say what units it is using.
