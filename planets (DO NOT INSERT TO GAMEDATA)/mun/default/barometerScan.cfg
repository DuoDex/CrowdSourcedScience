	RESULTS
	{
		default = The instrument refuses to cooperate until you warn it about breaking the ideal gas laws.
		default = You get thirsty and think about drinking from the barometer, but you can't tell if it's a water or mercury barometer and decide against it.
		default = The pressure levels appear to be negative, until you slap the computer and the values return to normal.
		default = Every time KSC asks you to transmit the readout, you feel like a TV-weathercaster.
		default = The reading says "Hurricane". Tapping on the glass doesn't help.
		default = As entertaining as it is to blow on the sensor and watch the needle move, Mission Control insists that's not what it's there for.
		default = You wonder why the screen is blank. Then you realize you forgot to turn it on.
		default = Collected and recorded atmospheric pressure data from the surroundings.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a fine day today.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a storm will arrive later. Version 0.25 maybe?
		KerbinFlyingLow = The pressure is lower here than it was at ground level.
		MohoFlyingLow = The barometer reading is too low to measure. This planet has no atmosphere.
		MohoSrfLanded = The barometer is still reading nothing.
		MohoSrfLanded = You could have sworn there was an atmosphere on Moho, but the barometer reads nothing.
		MohoSrfLanded = You’re pretty sure the barometer just showed an atmosphere! Oh, wait, that was just the engine exhaust.
		MohoSrfLanded = Remembering heroic science fiction stories about crews trying to survive in Moho’s extremely hot atmosphere, you just shrug with disappointment.
		EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
		EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
		EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is very high even at this altitude.
		EveSrfLanded = The pressure is cursing down here! You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.
		EveSrfLanded = Atmosphere? Yes!
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing."
		EveSrfLanded = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.
		EveSrfLanded = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any kerbals there.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.
		EveSrfLanded = It's buried the needle!
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.
		EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is very dense at the surface. It crushes down on the instrumentation.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.
		EveSrfLanded = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.
		GillySrfLanded = The barometer registers something as a speck of dust lands in the sensor.
		GillySrfLanded = You think that you've got a reading for a second... nope, just a smudge on the gauge.
		GillySrfLanded = Doing pressure measurements on Gilly? Are you stupid or something?
		MunFlyingLow = Just for kicks you measure the pressure here. Yep, no atmosphere.
		MunSrfLanded = The pressure gauge is sitting there motionless. Perhaps you should tap it a few times to be sure?
		MunSrfLanded = They say insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results. You check the gauge again. Still nothing.
		MunSrfLanded = The barometer shows zero. Somehow this hurts your feelings.
		DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.
		DunaFlyingLow = Even the barometer isn’t sure how to interpret the readings.
		DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads "Gasping for air!" You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.
		DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere is pretty thin even at the surface. You don't think parachutes or wings would work very well here.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it’s still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
		DunaSrfLanded = There isn’t much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
		IkeFlyingLow = There appears to be no atmosphere here.
		IkeSrfLanded = Barometer is quite a fun word, way more fun than what barometer actually does. Or these readings for that matter, which are just solid, round zeroes.
		IkeSrfLanded = The gauge reads nothing, even on the surface.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere. But there are very few moons with atmospheres, so what did you expect?
		JoolFlyingLow = You notice the barometer has a crack in it shaped like a doughnut. There's also a reading about the pressure, but you've stopped caring.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer's hand switched from "You sure we're in an atmosphere and not underwater?" to "Look, I wasn't built to record pressures in kbar". It suddenly dawns on you that you might have aerobraked a bit too deep.
		JoolFlyingLow = The sensor starts breaking under pressure.
		JoolFlyingLow = The immense pressure causes the sensor to implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = Pressure increases quite rapidly, then stabilises on "-65535". It occurs to you that barometer may be broken.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer reads lower than expected. Perhaps you are in the eye of a storm?
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer lets out some steam and fails to give a proper reading of the immensely thick atmosphere.
		JoolFlyingLow = The scanner only has time to say "I hate you" before the voice module implodes.
		JoolFlyingLow = The gas chamber just cracked. Any deeper and this whole craft might implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = The pressures here are immense. The instrument is beginning to fail.
		JoolFlyingLow = Jool seems to be under a lot of pressure right now.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The pressures start rising in comparison to the surrounding area. You take this as a good sign -- Joolian storms are nothing to sneeze at.
		JoolFlyingHigh = A massive blast of wind shakes the spacecraft. Of course, you didn't exactly need a barometer to tell you this.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is very dense. The glass components appear to be weakening. Let's blame the engineers if anything breaks!
		JoolFlyingHigh = The pressure here is very high. It seems dangerous to probe any deeper.
		Laythe = The atmosphere here is unusually dense.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The pressure seems higher over the water.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
		LaytheFlyingLow = There is definitely an atmosphere. Pressures are fairly nominal.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The barometer predicts rain.
		LaytheSrfLanded = For a couple of seconds you think the device is still displaying readings taken on Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The readings are almost the same as on a sunny beach back home. It makes you feel like going for a swim.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is a bit lower than on Kerbin. You are unsure if that makes it more fun or not.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is lower than on Kerbin, but you don’t think seasoned mountaineers would have any trouble adapting to it.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The pressures here seem to be a bit lower than that of Kerbin. Definitely manageable, though.
		VallFlyingLow = There does not appear to be any atmosphere to sample.
		VallSrfLanded = Gases rising from the planet occasionally register slight pressures. That, or the instrument is on the fritz.
		VallSrfLanded = If there is an atmosphere, it’s way too thin to register on the barometer.
		Tylo = Searching for an atmosphere on this barren rock is rather futile.
		TyloFlyingLow = Surprisingly, you discover no traces of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = The vacuum seems a little bit thicker here.
		TyloSrfLanded = There is no detectable atmospheric pressure here. Fascinating!
		TyloSrfLanded = Why such a massive body acquired no atmosphere is a complete mystery to you.
		BopFlyingLow = It's a giant rock floating through space. What did you expect?
		BopSrfLanded = Yup. Just a rock.
		BopSrfLanded = Instruments again support the theory that asteroids are too small to have an atmosphere.
		PolFlyingLow = Nothing to report here.
		PolSrfLanded = No atmospheric pressure is detectable on Pol.
		EelooFlyingLow = The instrument doesn't register any pressure here.
		EelooSrfLanded = The air here, besides being absent, is also very lonely.
		EelooSrfLanded = Beep... beep... beep... boop. The instrument has frozen up.
		EelooSrfLanded = The indicator shifts back and forth, then finally settles on zero.
		EelooSrfLanded = No trace of an atmosphere. In this intense cold, most gases would have frozen and precipitated to the surface.
		DresSrfLanded = If there is an atmosphere, it's way too thin for the barometer to detect. Such a disappointment.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You contemplate dunking the scanner to see if it can measure depth, but mission control says that will void the warranty.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Atmospheric pressure at sea level is quite high, but still less than on Kerbin. Well, it's a moon, give it a break!
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storms fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = It's not going to rain for a long time.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarified, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.
		EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The barometer displays "0" in a surprisingly condescending fashion.
		EveSrfSplashed = The pressure is very high. You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this purple sea.
		EveSrfSplashed = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer reads low pressure. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = There's air here, but not much of it.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.
