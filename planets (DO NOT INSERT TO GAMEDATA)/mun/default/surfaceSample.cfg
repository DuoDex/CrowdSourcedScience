		default = You break off a piece of the ground. It tastes like dirt!
		default = After kicking the ground several times, you are convinced it is solid and should be taken home to investigate.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You wonder why you put on a two-million-dollar space suit and got into a multi-billion dollar rocket just to pick up some dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Looks like dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Beautiful green grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Still dirt.

		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I didn’t sign up for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = An incredibly long, furry, purple creature slithers bizarrely out of the grass. You rub your eyes and when you look again there is nothing in sight.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I got a jar o’ dirt! I got a jar o’ dirt!
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You pick at the dirt and discover a worm under the grass. You promptly name him Kelbin and attempt to hug him but end up squishing him in your arms. You feel bad so you open up a container and gently place him inside.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Dirt, grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a groundbreaking discovery.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You discover dried out straw, lichens, and moss.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You find a tiny fleck of a shiny yellow material among the rocks. It seems that there is gold in these hills.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The air is thin, the climate is frigid, and the ground is impenetrable.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you're in a climate-controlled suit, because it sure looks hot out there.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Sand, sand, and more sand. A rock adds some badly needed variety to the landscape.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You saw a blue box on the horizon, but it was just an illusion. Also, you picked up a stone.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You remember your wilderness survival training… wait, do you need that training in space? What are you doing here in the desert? Someone is going to answer for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here is partially frozen and tufts of moose hair cover the matted grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the cracking sounds. You try to not think back on how you landed there.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You take a sample of the “ice.” Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You pick up a small creature with far too many legs. Mission control denies your request to keep it as a pet.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You scoop up some watery sand and decide the best use for it is to build a sand castle.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Hey look, a wristwatch! Finders, keepers!
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You build a sand castle, then take a sample of it. It’s sand.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The grass here is definitely not as green as it is in other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called “the Badlands” makes you feel cool.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Rock, coal, and dead plant matter make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You scoop up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample, you hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = "Dihydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = There seems to be a lot of a liquid substance. Surely this will be a huge advancement in science as we know it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = This material seems to take on the shape of whatever container it is placed in. More study is needed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You seem to have captured a small crustacean. Mission Control is less than impressed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Curious - something essential to life that isn't green, isn't explosive, and doesn't start with "K."
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Is that an engine bell?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You attempt to pry off a sample, but Mission Control yells at you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Don’t we already know what this is made out of?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You bend down to "gather samples," but decide to make some chalk drawings instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Getting a sample here will be tricky. Hey look, a penny!
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The sample is composed of some sort of grey rock, with one half of it nearly perfectly smooth.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Mission Control would like to remind you that, while we appreciate your efforts towards research, we already have a good understanding of the makeup of our runway.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land on.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = After examining the asphalt, you conclude that it would be a great place to cook an egg.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You're sure this area is pretty well studied, but you did find a nickle.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Dirt, dust, and burnt flecks of steel make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Looks like… dirt. And rocks. And more dirt. Why are you out here again?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your metal detector beeps and whizzes a bit. After careful digging, you find part of the engine from Jeb’s pickup truck. How it got there you don’t know, but you do know why Jeb’s truck isn’t in the parking lot today.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You see small metal scraps from the latest rocket explosion scattered around the ground.
		Mun = Done and dusted.
		MunSrfLanded = You take a sample and confirm that the Mun is not made of cheese.
		MunSrfLanded = Wensleydale? Stilton? It isn't like any cheese you've tasted. You wonder if its actually cheese at all.
		MunSrfLanded = You suddenly realize why the physical examination screened for breathing problems.
		MunSrfLanded = Oddly enough, the sample smells similar to swiss cheese. One wonders if it's edible.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.
		MunSrfLanded = Unfortunately, it's not cheese. You double-check it, but it still isn't.
		MunSrfLanded = You note the sample's lack of cheese.
		MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a greyish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.
		MunSrfLanded = Finally, something that isn’t dirt: a rock!
		MunSrfLanded = So, breccias are actually kind of boring.
		MunSrfLanded = Through extensive and professional testing, you find out that, contrary to popular belief, the Mun is not made of cheese. Also, you immediately regret your testing.
		MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The ground appears to be made of very small, sharp, abrasive pieces of grey rock. It would probably be best if you didn't rub your space suit against the stuff.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = Very... rocky.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The darker midlands surface appears to be made up of basaltic rocks.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The sample contains odd glass spherules of various colors. They're quite pretty!

		MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The sample appears to be radioactive.
		MunSrfLandedSouthWestCrater = There appears to be layers of completely different materials here. It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.
		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Tiny flecks of purple flesh dot the mineral deposits here. The texture of the crater looks quite puckered. Is this evidence that this was once the home of the legendary Kraken?
		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured here.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = To your surprise, you find a large lump of ice lodged in the center of the crater. Upon further analysis you find that it doesn't taste particularly well, and is too chunky for the snow-cone machine.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = You examine the sample you’ve collected, and throw it into the container for further testing.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder if this would make a nice snack.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realise that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you’ve collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.
		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The sample seems to contain frozen liquids... we should send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = You take a small rock and your nine iron, place the rock on a T, and knock it into low orbit.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The Mun dust here is light and thin... It's very poor sandcastle-building material. That doesn't stop you from making one.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = Seems muddy, in a waterless kind of way. You find it appropriate to remove your shoes before boarding the ship again, no thought given to the problems of removing space attire while still outside.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = This crater seems to filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for something neat.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Then, you throw a less cool looking rock into the sample container.
		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = This crater must have had a really nasty impact, the samples are heavier than normal.
		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = You're glad that the Mun's gravity is so low. Digging is backbreaking work!
		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Definitely not Cheddar. Winchester? No. Dorset Blue Vinney? Nah.

		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Continual samples of this area confirm it is rich in useful materials.
		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You dig around for a nice sample of the crater, carefully selecting some of everything.
		Minmus = As you gather up some Minmus material, you label it as "Definitely not ice".
		MinmusSrfLanded = You scoop a sample up to be analysed back home, then smear some over your gloves to sniff when you get back in the capsule. You bet it'll smell minty and delicious.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You taste the sample, and find that it does not taste like mint at all. You wonder where the medicine cabinet went.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You are disappointed to discover that the sample does not taste like ice cream, but instead tastes more like frozen yogurt.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control tentatively asks you how it tastes.
		MinmusSrfLanded = After excavating the surface, you find a hidden ice layer. The ice appears to have a slightly greenish tinge to it. Upon further examination, you find it to have the perfect consistency for snow-cones, yet the taste leaves much to be desired.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You try to taste the sample but your helmet gets in the way.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The white mountains have a snow-like surface. The frozen lakes seem to be made of the same substance, but much smoother.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Must... not... taste...
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains. They are very pretty, but probably not edible. Probably.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You sneak a taste of the surface sample... nope, it definitely is not made of delicious dessert products.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Surface samples confirm that it is not made out of mint, even though it looks and tastes like it.
		Eve = Oooooo. Purple!
		EveSrfLanded = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this colour falls as precipitation.
		EveSrfLanded = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it worth it? Sure! It's purple!
		EveSrfLanded = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.
		EveSrfLanded = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?
		EveSrfLanded = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.
		EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
		EveSrfLanded = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it just reflecting that color from its surroundings? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.
		EveSrfLanded = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.
		EveSrfLanded = I’ve come all this way for THIS?
		EveSrfLanded = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 kerbals.
		EveSrfSplashed = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
		EveSrfSplashed = The purple water dyes the suit pink.
		EveSrfSplashed = Further analysis will determine if this liquid is indeed grape-flavoured, as you hope it is.
		EveSrfSplashed = Johnny was a chemist's son, / But Johnny is no more; / What Johnny thought was H2O / was H2SO4.
		EveSrfSplashed = You try tasting your sample, and find that it is indeed not grape soda.
		EveSrfSplashed = This purplish liquid sample looks like your favourite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.
		EveSrfSplashed = You find traces of liquid Blutonium.

		EveSrfSplashed = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin’s core.
		Duna = The exact chemical composition of the surface will no doubt be of interest to the scientists back home.
		Duna = Different colored rocks are probably made of different stuff. You should grab as many as you can.
		DunaSrfLanded = It appears this soil could be used for snack production, possibly after several centuries of kerbal-forming.
		DunaSrfLanded = This red dust could be iron oxide, or possibly paprika.
		DunaSrfLanded = You wonder if you need to take a sample considering there is so much dust on you that you could be considered a sample on your own right.
		DunaSrfLanded = Nope. Not barbecue flavored.
		DunaSrfLanded = Yup. Dust. Are you surprised?
		DunaSrfLanded = It's very thin and fine. You imagine a rover could easily become stuck in this if it had small wheels.

		DunaSrfLanded = The small rock you pick up seems to be of sedimentary origin. You wonder if there was ever a lake here.
		DunaSrfLanded = You find a nice metal ruler in the sand! You’re ready to proclaim the discovery of an alien civilization, but then you find that the one in your suit is missing.
		DunaSrfLanded = The rock you’ve picked up seems to contain a lot of iron oxide III. As such, it’s not tasty, nor particularly healthy.
		DunaSrfLanded = Too bad it’s only red spice. It would have been much better to go to Eve.
		DunaSrfLanded = You pick up a soil sample. It looks a bit like limestone. You consider it important and put it into your sample container.

		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks lying around seem to be ejecta from volcanic eruptions.
		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks all look the same to you. Wishing you had taken that geology course back on Kerbin, you try to break some stones by hitting them hard against each other. They seem to be very sturdy and don’t break at all.
		MohoSrfLanded = Ahah! You spot a familiar-looking rock a couple of meters away from you. It reminds you of the snack pack you’ve just eaten.
		MohoSrfLanded = Yup, its a chunk of Moho.

		GillySrfLanded = You have a hard time picking up some dust samples as it flies out of your scoop and into the sky.
		GillySrfLanded = You could almost fit this 'moon' into the container.
		GillySrfLanded = You grab a large boulder, at least twice your size, only to realize that it won't fit in the ship. You casually toss it off to the side and pick a more reasonable sample.
		GillySrfLanded = You accidentally toss the sample into the air and it sails off into space, so you grab another one.
		GillySrfLanded = This sample may contain the secrets of the formation of the Solar System! Or it might just be a bit of dirt and rocks...
		GillySrfLanded = Taking a surface sample in low gravity is kinda tricky. As you dig the shovel in, the reaction force sends you flying upwards.
		GillySrfLanded = Unfortunately, the surface is composed of loose rock of various sizes. It looks like you'll have to wait a while longer for that baked potato.
		GillySrfLanded = The surface gives away easily and you have a hard time keeping the sample in the container due to the low gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = Carborundum - clear evidence that Gilly was once subjected to a whole lot of “boom boom.”
		GillySrfLanded = Your Geiger counter clicks too many times to warrant keeping this.
		GillySrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It looks so dull that you throw it away in irritation. It soars into the skies, disappearing over horizon. You wonder if it made an orbit until it hits you in the head from behind.

		DresSrfLanded = The grey metallic sand looks nice and shiny, so you make a sandcastle.
		DresSrfLanded = You find traces of a large number of elements, likely deposited here by impacts over time.
		DresSrfLanded = You take some sand. The color will go great on your sandcastle at home.
		DresSrfLanded = After digging around for a bit, you find some nice bits of glass and throw them in your sample container.
		JoolFlyingLow = Surface samples suggest you should really get out of here.
		JoolFlyingLow = Jool’s atmosphere is thick enough to capture in a container while moving. The science team at home is just as excited as you are.

		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil contains a lot of silica and feels very rough.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to form a castle out of the soil. For science, of course.
		VallSrfLanded = As you dig into the blue ice, a particularly nasty quake sends your shovel flying. Perhaps you shouldn't dig any deeper...
		VallSrfLanded = Strangely, some of the ice on the surface seems significantly fresher than the rest.
		VallSrfLanded = The icy crystals show signs of shock and sharp temperature change at some point in the past.
		VallSrfLanded = After crushing some of the surface ice into a snow-cone and getting permission from mission control for an experiment, you find it doesn't taste particularly nice.
		VallSrfLanded = You chip away at the frozen surface and deposit some blue material in a container.
		VallSrfLanded = You dig around in the surface and find some beautiful green and blue crystal structures. They remind you of home, but you're unable to pick out Kerbin from the mass of twinkling lights.
		TyloSrfLanded = You quickly scoop up some white dust. You ran out of condiments three months ago.
		TyloSrfLanded = The rock sample is similar to what could be found on the Mun. There seems to be less evidence of volcanic activity, however.
		TyloSrfLanded = The ground gives way easily but the surface underneath is much harder.
		TyloSrfLanded = You hum a little tune to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface seems to be composed of rocks and ice. You quickly run density-mass calculations in your head, wondering how a moon has so much gravity.
		TyloSrfLanded = Some rock samples exhibit high heavy metal content.
		BopSrfLanded = Just under the brown surface you find a black, glassy material and put it in the sample bag. A volcanic residue perhaps?

		BopSrfLanded = The soil here is surprisingly soft, like play-koh.
		BopSrfLanded = The brown dust stains all the parts of your suit that it comes in contact with. Mission Control finds this quite amusing. You’re sure the laundry team will not.

		BopSrfLanded = You pick up a rock from the ground. It looks somewhat unusual so you put it into the container.
		BopSrfLanded = The rocks lying around look very dull and in no way remind you of potatoes. You shove one into your sample container, just to pass time.
		BopSrfLanded = You pick up an orange mineral. It appears to be soft and very moist.
		PolSrfLanded = As you pick up the sample, your eyes start to water. Thinking it would not be good to sneeze in your suit, you put the chunk of surface back down.
		PolSrfLanded = As you shovel the contents into a container, you can't help but feel you're allergic to whatever it is.
		PolSrfLanded = The sample is the same mottle of colors as the rest of the planet. You check off a box on your list.
		PolSrfLanded = After studying some samples, you’re fairly certain that Pol is not, in fact, made of pollen. This will cause quite the stir back home.
		PolSrfLanded = You feel slight irritation as you shove a handful of colourful sand into the storage container.
		PolSrfLanded = The rock sample you take crumbles into dust in your hand. You put it into your bag.
		Eeloo = Looks like Rocky Road...

		LaytheSrfSplashed = The liquid, though definitely water, contains impurities that seem to help it maintain a liquid state at these temperatures.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You manage to take a sip of local water through the oxygen supply tube. It definitely looks like water, acts like water, smells like water and... it does not taste like water at all. You hope you have medicine on the ship.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = This sample seems to have all the basic compounds required for life.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You try a drink. It feels like a cold glacier and tastes like... well, tap water.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You notice that someone may have planted onions here once.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Years of training has brought kerbalkind here, to find this handful of soil! You hope you won't be fired for that.

		MinmusSrfLandedFlats = You want to get your helmet off and taste the sample. instead, you pull yourself together and continue with the mission.
		MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The surface is perfectly flat and smooth. You have to use your shovel to dig out some ice.
		MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The ground appears to be made of small, cyan crystals. It doesn't look like it would be enjoyable walking barefoot here.
		MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = Ice up here has a very high reflectivity, which must significantly contribute to the high albedo of Minmus.
		MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = You realize that the ground here looks more like cookie dough then the mint ice cream on the flat lands. Your mouth starts to water.
		MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = The sample you've taken indicates that the surface is made from different types of snow and ice intricately intermixed with each other.
		MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = You take a handful of snow, ice, and dirt and put it into your sample bag. You hope the science team on Kerbin will figure out what it is and why it's not suitable for kerbal consumption.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = It's snow, ice, some loose dirt, and a couple of pebbles, frozen together in a strangely complicated way.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = It's just ice, with occasional snowflakes here and there.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The sample consists of multiple layers of very reflective greenish ice. You wonder what compound gives it such a nice colour.
		MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The sample contains several distinct types of ice frozen to form a complex, multi-layered pattern.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = You see that The Goo has formed itself into a ice cream cone, You note how yummy it looks.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The surface here looks even tastier than everywhere else.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = It has the consistency of a snowball, and is likely to be just as good at being thrown into other kerbals' faces.
		EveSrfLandedImpactSites = The surface sample reveals a lot of interesting chemical compounds. They suggest that much of the body that hit Eve burned up before reaching the planet's surface.
		EveSrfLandedImpactSites = The soil seems to be significantly heavier here.
		VallInSpace = This reminds you of Minmus, only bubblegum flavor...
		DresSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The soil is very dark here. You are sure the scientists back on Kerbin will be able to find something interesting about the composition of Dres if you can get it back to them.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The soil here is like tundra, dirt mixed with ice crystals, with a thin layer of fresh white frost on top.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.
		IkeSrfLandedCentralDepressions = The soil sample is one of the darkest coloured things you have ever encountered in your life. You put it in the bottom of the sample container and try to forget how much it scared you.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = The ground here appears to be mostly basalt from ancient lava flows, with a thin coating of sand and dust.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The floor of this depression seems to be composed of sedimentary rocks.
