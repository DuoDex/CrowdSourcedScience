		EveSrfLanded = You start to think that it’s entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn’t hurt to taste it… right?

		GillySrfLanded = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you’d brought an anchor.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Staring down at tiny Kerbin, it strikes you as a planet that looks mostly harmless.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see my house from here!
		SunSrfLanded = Who are you? Scott Manley?

		SunInSpaceHigh = You decide to have a staring contest with Kerbol. You lose.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The sun appears... yellow?
		SunInSpaceHigh = Having spent time in stellar orbit, you request that you be declared a new planet. Mission Control promises to think about it.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Looking around, you notice lots of sparkly things. One of them is REALLY sparkly.
		SunInSpaceHigh = They should have sent a poet. It's so beautiful.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You look out into the universe and wonder if you're alone, if Kerbin is a cradle of life in an otherwise sterile universe. Mission Control tells you to stop thinking so much.
		SunInSpaceHigh = It would have been better if it was green.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You feel kind of small right now... you hope you know where you're going.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You search in every direction, but there is no kraken to be seen.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Suddenly you hear a deep growling. Is that the space kraken?
		SunInSpaceHigh = Staring into the void, you ponder your place in the universe.
		SunInSpaceLow = You release a gray rock from your space suit pocket and make a resolution to come back in a year to find out if it looks like Moho.

		SunInSpaceLow = You wonder if the radiation from Kerbol is harming you in any way.
		SunInSpaceLow = Your spacesuit is starting to heat up now. Maybe it's a good idea to get back to your spacecraft.

		SunInSpaceLow = You are starting to sweat profusely and wonder why you had left the capsule in the first place.
		SunInSpaceLow = You feel as if you should have brought a stronger sunscreen.

		KerbinFlyingLow = This is a most precarious situation.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Flying this close to the ground is definitely not over-rated!
		KerbinFlyingLow = Get back in! Quick!
		KerbinFlyingLow = The ground is looking awful close. Did you pack a parachute?
		KerbinFlyingLow = This isn’t that high up after all…
		KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there’s nothing you can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It’s so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.
		Mun = It looks like a really big rock.
		MunSrfLanded = You feel a peculiar quake. When you look behind you, there is a fresh meteor impacted where you were just walking.
		MunSrfLanded = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.
		MunSrfLanded = You wonder how that rock got into your spacesuit.
		MunSrfLanded = It doesn't -taste- like it's made of dairy...

		MunSrfLanded = You should have brought your golf club.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust is getting everywhere!

		MunFlyingLow = Does it count as a mountain if it’s in space?
		MunFlyingLow = You're having a bit too much fun with the low gravity.
		MunFlyingLow = You try flapping your arms to go higher. After doing this, you try to perform a facepalm, but only manage a visor palm.
		MunFlyingHigh = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you exit your craft, you utter the words; "It's one small step for kerbals, one giant leap for kerbal kind."
		MinmusSrfLanded = Engine's exhaust seems to have melted the ice underneath.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You spend several minutes contemplating how to taste the ground without removing your space suit's helmet before giving up.

		MinmusSrfLanded = You need to do something about the lack of snacks here.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You feel a bit like a superhero when you jump in the low gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You are craving mint ice cream right about now.

		MinmusSrfLanded = If the spaceship fails, you could probably use the jetpack to get back into orbit.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to be a mixture of rock and ice… you wonder if it could be mined for fuel.
		MinmusSrfLanded = These ice lakes are so flat and smooth, you suspect they would make an excellent drag strip.

		DunaSrfLanded = You feel like a true hero as you march across the red planet, until you realize you're a long, long way from home.
		DunaSrfLanded = I'm hungry. Where is my pizza?
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's low gravity would lend itself well to an exciting game of baskerbal! You consider adding a hoop to your next lander design.
		DunaSrfLanded = You see red. A LOT of red.
		DunaSrfLanded = After much testing, you determine that red sand castles are plausible.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air is a little thin up here. Down here?
		DunaSrfLanded = A gust of wind creates a small red dust storm, it’s hard to see.
		Ike = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life coul- "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
		IkeSrfLanded = It seems like a hike would be nice. What might you see from the other side of this moon? Pack plenty of air!
		IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
		IkeSrfLanded = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
		IkeSrfLanded = You look up at the sky and see something zip past...
		IkeSrfLanded = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface. The surface appears to react oddly to light.
		IkeSrfLanded = You get a strange sense of deja-vu.

		DresSrfLanded = For a planet of this size and gravity, there are an awful lot of craters.
		DresSrfLanded = When you look closely at the ground, you can see many different types of deposits mixed together.
		DresSrfLanded = You feel like a few smaller rocks should be visible in the distance. However, when you look up, you spot nothing of the sort.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You feel your skin burn as you leave the vessel. It would be a good idea to get back on board!
		JoolFlyingHigh = You find that the outside pressures are equal with your suit's interior pressure. Removing your helmet would still be a rather poor idea.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Feeling insignificant near the towering mass of the gas giant, you are inclined to think that size matters after all.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.

		LaytheSrfLanded = You search the sky, hoping to see Jool.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Gazing around the landscape, you feel very homesick.
		LaytheSrfLanded = There might be good diving on this planet. Unfortunately, mission control did not pack any flippers.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It is much colder here than the scan from orbit suggested.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You feel a slight tremor. Perhaps you should have landed on that OTHER island.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Comfortable enough to take your helmet off, you check the box for “Looks breathable.”
		LaytheSrfLanded = You take your helmet off, and after a few very long seconds of gasping and haphazard flailing you manage to secure your helmet again. You erase the checkbox for “breathable atmosphere.”
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet’s protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it’s because of lower oxygen content.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air looks tolerable and the water looks very inviting. A beautiful place to be!
		LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The low land to water ratio and sedate water cycle of Laythe combine to give its oceans low salinity. You're forced to constantly swim to keep afloat.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could swim to the nearest island.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You realise that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As much as you'd like to find life, the only green wiggling creature here is in a spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You attempt to drink some water. Then you remember the co-worker who died after ordering some "H2O too".
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You tread water. Perhaps you should have chosen a drier landing spot.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Swimming is really hard in these suits you know.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Your Geiger Counter is emitting a continuous hum. Time to flee.
		Vall = You see a sparkling stream of crystals blast into the sky in the distance.
		VallSrfLanded = The ground beneath you suddenly lurches, and you hear the sound, carried up through your feet, of immense ice plates scraping against each other.
		VallSrfLanded = Well, the ice is... thick. You wonder if there's a frozen waterfall somewhere.
		VallSrfLanded = The surface shivers as the deeper crust buckles and fractures. You want badly to get back inside the ship now.
		VallSrfLanded = The rocks are of a bluish-green colour... Pretty!
		VallSrfLanded = The ground rumbles ominously beneath you before you realise that you're just hungry.
		VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think you should probably get back to the ship.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice crystals look very shiny.
		VallSrfLanded = You wish you’d brought your ice skates.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice melts down and evaporates from the friction of your space boots. You concentrate very hard on keeping your balance.
		VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think maybe the underground ocean the scientists predicted is not that far below.
		TyloSrfLanded = Is it me, or did my spacesuit just get really heavy?
		TyloSrfLanded = You try jumping... It isn't very effective
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and reminds you of home. The lack of atmosphere, however, provides a stark contrast.
		TyloSrfLanded = You look around, trying to decide if the nerve-wracking descent was worth it. How are you going to get back?
		TyloSrfLanded = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = If surface composition is of any indication, there is a distinct possibility of finding underground lakes and caverns somewhere around.
		TyloSrfLanded = They say the gravity of Tylo adds five pounds.
		BopSrfLanded = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.
		BopSrfLanded = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.
		BopSrfLanded = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
		BopSrfLanded = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it’s probably just your suit being out of order.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there’s something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.
		PolSrfLanded = Looking at all the jagged rocks, you feel very thankful about not landing on them.
		PolSrfLanded = Everywhere you look it appears the planet is sharp. You don't think you want to sit down or fall on anything.
		PolSrfLanded = Every edge looks dangerously sharp. You step carefully, trying not to shatter anything.
		PolSrfLanded = The rocks, the sand, and space itself seem to be filled with glitter. It gives you a headache.
		PolSrfLanded = This place might be very weird, but it’s not as bad as it could be.

		EelooSrfLanded = Even with spacesuit protecting you from the cold of space you feel yourself freezing... and lonely.
		EelooSrfLanded = You discover it is very cold. You ask mission control if you can get back into your ship now.
		EelooSrfLanded = You're standing on a giant dirty snowball.
		EelooSrfLanded = As you think about the distance and time it took to get you here, a sudden shiver runs down your spine.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what made you believe all the cheery people that assured you time and again that you were coming back.
		EelooSrfLanded = Even through the padding of your spacesuit, there's a distinct chill out here.
		EelooSrfLanded = The sun looks so distant now, compared to home...
		EelooSrfLanded = You step off the capsule to the crackling of ice under your boots. Your eyes adjust to the faint light. From way out here, Kerbol is just another star. You reflect upon the several year journey it took to get here.
		EelooSrfLanded = You start a pun about saying "Eeloo," but then Mission Control comes back from the bathroom.
		EelooSrfLanded = You lie down and make a snow kerbal.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel like Eeloo has been alone for a long time. You contemplate staying a little while longer.
		EelooSrfLanded = Even though the suit is well insulated, you can feel the cold seeping into your feet.
		EelooSrfLanded = It is very cold. You realize that you probably should have brought a sweater.
		EelooSrfLanded = You lay down and give the planet a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.
		EelooSrfLanded = You want to build a snow-kerbal. Sadly, Eeloo is made of ice, not snow.

		EveInSpace = From this position you can clearly make out lakes and oceans of some kind on the surface below.
		BopInSpace = The moon strikingly resembles a potato.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Mission Control assures you, "don't panic."
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = "Why did I go outside? I really want to get back into the capsule!"
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.
		JoolFlyingLow = I think I just heard something crack in my helmet. Can I go home?
		JoolFlyingLow = You are advised to get back into the capsule, fast.
		JoolFlyingLow = I should have taken a green space suit for camouflage.
		JoolFlyingLow = You feel a sudden urge to see what would happen if you landed on a gas giant.
		JoolFlyingLow = HOW DID I LET YOU GUYS TALK ME INTO THIS!?
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize that diving into a gas giant never sounded like a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = Kerbin, I think we have a problem. I do, anyways...
