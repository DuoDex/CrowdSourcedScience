	{
		default = You look at the results and understand that you have no idea what these numbers mean.
		default = A note is taped to the side of the instrument: "Does not measure fear."
		default = The sensors detect trace amounts of the installing technician's sandwich.
		default = You run an Atmosphere Analysis, recording various measurements like temperature, pressure, and atmosphere composition.
		default = You’d like to run an atmospheric analysis, but all you can smell is the cheese from your snack last night. So you just push buttons and hope something valuable, or cheesy, will come of it.
		default = Aaron Kerman was best known for his heroic final efforts in discovering that the Mun has no atmosphere. Now we use these sensors instead.
		Mun = After a brief analysis you conclude that the lack of data is very likely related to the local atmosphere's void-like composition.
		default = Yep. Works as specified.
		MohoSrfLanded = There appears to be no atmosphere here. However, there are trace elements being detected close to the surface.
		MohoSrfLanded = Having expected a thin, melting-hot atmosphere around Moho, you can’t help but wonder what those pesky science fiction writers were thinking.
		MohoSrfLanded = Nary a breeze.
		EveSrfLanded = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
		EveSrfLanded = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
		EveSrfLanded = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.
		EveSrfLanded = Though this is an atmosphere, it's definitely not something you want to breathe.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
		EveSrfLanded = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.
		EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird colour.
		EveFlyingHigh = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Mission controls insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.
		EveFlyingHigh = The highly corrosive gasses start pocking and stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.
		EveFlyingHigh = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.
		EveFlyingHigh = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.
		EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of superheated water vapor.
		GillySrfLanded = You make several analyzes and expect different results each time. Nope, still no atmosphere.
		GillySrfLanded = There is no detectable atmosphere.
		GillySrfLanded = People who thought there might be an atmosphere around Gilly should be banned from doing science forever.
		GillySrfLanded = You wonder why you brought the sensor here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Apparently, the atmosphere is made of ash and rocket fuel. But that might be because you're on the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = I think a fly just got in the research equipment... don't tell the scientists!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The extremely expensive array of sensors, samplers, and detectors has confirmed that today is a very good day to go to space. Which is nice, considering we already have the rocket out and everything.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The sensor detects an explosive atmosphere. Try getting off the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you’d expect from a thriving space program.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid, and seems to have a bit of a fishy smell to it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The humidity readings are off the charts! Open the hatch and check the sensor. Or not.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Sensors indicate a sudden decrease in ambient temperature and an increase in surrounding density.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You tap the sensor a few times, but it only spits sparks. Somebody should’ve told you it could only analyze air.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There’s lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There’s a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well. The goat one peak over is shivering
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito divebombing it. Apparently it’s carrying mal aria.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The sensors report that the air is cold but otherwise nominal.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere is very, very cold indeed. Some of the sensors have frozen shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It’s a tiny bit nippy here.
		MunSrfLanded = You didn't even stop to think about the lack of atmosphere here before installing this sensor did you?
		MunSrfLanded = The analysis shows not even a trace of air. You decide to see how long you can hold your breath, just in case.
		MunSrfLanded = Instruments detect a faint particulate aura around the surface. Not an atmosphere, but it may explain the reported lights on the horizon.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Atmospheric analysis indicates there is no atmosphere to analyze.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Atmospheric analysis identifies no harmful gasses in the current environment. In fact, it identifies no gasses in the current environment at all.
		MinmusSrfLanded = While there may be some vaguely minty traces, Minmus has no real atmosphere.
		MinmusSrfLanded = There are detectable gas emissions. But nothing that could be considered an atmosphere.
		Duna = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
		DunaSrfLanded = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaSrfLanded = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
		DunaSrfLanded = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer say the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
		DunaSrfLanded = The carbon dioxide in the air is thick enough that it could be harvested for plants in greenhouses. Wait, what?
		DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Duna is very, very thin. It might be possible to fly in it with large enough wings or a fast enough aircraft.
		DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be a larger concentration of heavy isotopes in the atmosphere than on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLanded = 255. Definitely 255.
		IkeSrfLanded = Either there's no atmosphere or the sensor is broken. Better not take your helmets off here, just in case.
		IkeSrfLanded = You run an analysis on the non-existent atmosphere.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is a faint aura of particles just like that of the Mün, but it can’t be called an atmosphere.
		DresSrfLanded = You hope that mission control sent you to somewhere with an atmosphere. You are disappointed and make a note to bring this up next time you speak to them.
		DresSrfLanded = There does not appear to be an atmosphere here.
		DresSrfLanded = It’s an airless world.
		DresSrfLanded = The scan reveals an atmosphere just like Kerbin’s... then you find a tiny hole above the scanner. Well, some bubble gum should fix that.
		Jool = The atmosphere seems to consist mostly of hydrogen and chlorine.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The sensors detect high concentrations of chlorine and helium. You are fascinated, but suspect your findings will cause some headaches for planetary scientists back on Kerbin.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis reveals unexpectedly high concentrations of molecular chlorine. You try not to think about what this corrosive gas might be doing to the spacecraft.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Microscopic diamonds, tossed up from liquid carbon far below, are detected in the scanner.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The Joolian clouds contain the expected hydrogen and helium, with substantial amounts of chlorine present.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium-3 with traces of chlorine. Don't breathe it!
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmospheric pressures are very high here and you detect a large number of gasses.
		JoolFlyingLow = It's so incredibly dense.
		JoolFlyingLow = Engineers scramble to adjust calculations to account for the new, very large crack in the instrument casing.
		JoolFlyingLow = The drag and pressure almost shut down the science machinery. The main report reads "Pressure Warning: Gain altitude immediately."
		JoolFlyingLow = The computer running the atmosphere analysis tool crashed. That's probably not good. Upon return, you plan to have a word with the engineers who designed this computer.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere here is made of little but hydrogen and helium.
		JoolFlyingLow = "Do you smell that? That smelly smell... it smells... smelly..."
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be very thick here.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere is getting much denser now. However, it appears to be unusually transparent.
		JoolFlyingLow = Don't be silly.
		JoolFlyingLow = The Chlorine content is extremely high here, explaining how the planet got its distinctive green colour.
		JoolFlyingLow = The instrument is having trouble sampling at these densities.
		JoolFlyingLow = The instrument housing is starting to buckle under the immense pressure.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!
		LaytheSrfLanded = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. You shouldn't volunteer to go out first without a helmet on however.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Breathing this probably wouldn’t kill you... immediately.
		VallSrfLanded = There are traces of cryovolcanic compounds. But not a full atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = There appears to be only faint traces of the heaviest isotopes on the surface.
		BopSrfLanded = The sensors detected organic compounds for a second. Possibly a mistake.
		BopSrfLanded = The sensors detect nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing lives here. Promise.
		BopSrfLanded = Despite the lack of an atmosphere, sensors indicate… sushi?
		PolSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere to speak of. But you sample the temperature anyways.
		PolSrfLanded = You detect a dense atmosphere of solid metallic oxides. Oh... wait... it’s just dust.
		EelooSrfLanded = The only atmosphere here seems to be lying around in frozen lumps.
		EelooSrfLanded = A lot of energy was expended to bring an atmospheric package all the way out here for nothing.
		EelooSrfLanded = The dust from landing is tricking the sensor into thinking there's an atmosphere here.
		DunaFlyingLow = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
		DunaFlyingLow = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingLow = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into… *ahem.*
		DunaFlyingLow = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
		DunaFlyingLow = Much of the atmosphere is dust that's blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
		EveFlyingLow = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.
		EveFlyingLow = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?
		EveFlyingLow = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!
		EveFlyingLow = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingLow = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.
		EveFlyingLow = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingLow = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.
		EveFlyingLow = It's thick, purple, and full of hot air. What did you expect?
		LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be made up of oxygen and nitrogen. You wonder at the high chlorine content, though.
		LaytheFlyingLow = There's Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and lots of water. You scribble down a note: "Invest in colonization program."
		LaytheFlyingLow = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photodissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
		LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.
		EelooInSpace = If there is an atmosphere, it's almost undetectable -- likely from the cryogenic volcanoes spewing stuff everywhere.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
		MunInSpaceLow = Despite what some say, the Mun does not feature an atmosphere.
		SunInSpaceLow = Kerbol is emitting mostly helium and hydrogen, with trace elements occasionally blipping the screen. Perhaps a party supply store or blimp company would want to mine it?
		DunaFlyingHigh = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also higher.
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel relieved that you have plenty of oxygen left in your tanks, wherever they are.
		EveSrfSplashed = Acidic vapors are eating away at the sensor.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much dryer over the desert.
