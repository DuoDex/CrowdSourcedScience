		PolSrfLanded = After squinting at the device, you can still see vibrations from your landing on the screen, circling the (very tiny) globe.
		PolSrfLanded = These results are gibberish! The interior of this little moon must be messier than Bob's office.
		PolSrfLanded = The sensor registers very weak vibrations, which could provide a clue as to why Pol is that crumbled up.
		PolSrfLanded = There seems to be a lot of seismic activity around Pol's poles.
		PolSrfLanded = Apart from the occasional kerbal falling down the cliff, there is nothing for the seismometer to detect.
		PolSrfLanded = The loose soil transits vibration differently than on other bodies.
		PolSrfLanded = Vibrations reflect off the jagged structures inside the moon.
