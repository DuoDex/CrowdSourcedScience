		PolInSpace = The sensor picks up multiple layers under the surface of the planet.
		PolSrfLanded = There are roughly twice as many left-handed negative graviolis as right-handed ones here. That means something. Nobody knows what, though.
		PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol.
