	{
		Jool = The massive gas giant's gravity well takes hold of your craft. You begin to wonder how much fuel you have left.
		Jool = You begin to understand the gravity of the situation.
		JoolInSpace = Jool has much higher gravity than Kerbin.
		JoolInSpace = The sensor calibrates before measuring the massive gravitational forces of Jool.
		JoolInSpace = The sensor picks up a wealth of information about the local planetary system.
		JoolFlyingLow = The readings fluctuate tremendously as the moons pass by.
		JoolFlyingLow = The sensor is painfully giving readouts while trying to keep itself in one piece.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's massive gravity well causes time to slow from your perspective. Great Scott!
		JoolInSpaceLow = You secure the sensor with a few more bolts just in case. It trembles in fear, but you give it a reassuring pat.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The science team is going to get to write that "Large things in space produce large numbers" paper after all.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Yup. It's big.
