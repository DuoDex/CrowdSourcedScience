		JoolInSpace = The computer gives an odd report no matter how many times you send the request. "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," is the only reply. You open the fuse box panel, and the the computer suddenly starts behaving again.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Jool's immense gravity is pulling the materials towards one side of the container.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The intense crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Superheating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
		JoolFlyingLow = The pressure of the Jool's atmosphere is so high that a few of the samples have begun fusing together.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The camera shows a rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
