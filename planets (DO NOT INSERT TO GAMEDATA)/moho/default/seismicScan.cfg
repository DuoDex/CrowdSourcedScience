		Moho = There is a strong anomaly in the sensor that you can't determine the cause of. After much deliberation, you decide to ignore it.
		MohoSrfLanded = The meter shows the maximum amount of force needed to jiggle Jebediah's love-handles for a fortnight.
		MohoSrfLanded = This place seems much calmer than you would think. Tests indicate that there hasn't been any geologic activity in billions of years.
		MohoSrfLanded = Thermal expansion from the sun is causing geological activity.
		MohoSrfLanded = The shaking of the needle reminds you how cold the dark side of this planet gets.
		MohoSrfLanded = Despite the tremendous heat of the sun, thermal expansion isn't causing any noteworthy movement.
		MohoSrfLanded = The sensor detects vibrations deep inside the planet. It appears that the interior is very volcanically active.
		MohoSrfLanded = Odd reflections are detected in the recorded vibrations. This might tell us more about the interior structure.
		MohoSrfLanded = The sensor picks up anomalous vibrations from deep within the planet. You wonder what could be down there.
		MohoSrfLanded = A small rumble shakes the cockpit before you can access the sensor.
