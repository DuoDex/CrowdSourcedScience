		MohoSrfLanded = The samples have taken well to Moho and are now brown.
		MohoSrfLanded = The racks holding the samples melt in a highly interesting fashion.
		MohoSrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
		MohoSrfLanded = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.
		MohoSrfLanded = The samples start sweating.
		MohoSrfLanded = You record trace amounts of evaporated samples.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = The materials have been affected by the intense heat and many of the softer ones have melted entirely.
		MohoInSpaceLow = Some of the samples suggest Moho has a weak magnetic field.
