		MohoSrfLanded = The melted thermometer makes you question the safety of this mission.
		MohoSrfLanded = The temperature is very high and appears to fluctuate to extremes in the sunlight.
		MohoSrfLanded = Temperature in the shadow seems to be quite low.
		MohoSrfLanded = The temperature here is so hot the thermometer has melted entirely. No matter, you send the data back anyway.
		MohoSrfLanded = With every fan in the pod on, you don’t need a thermometer to tell you it’s hot.
		MohoSrfLanded = It’s cold. Wait...
		MohoInSpaceLow = You guessed it would be at least a million billion degrees this close to the Sun... but it isn't.
		MohoInSpaceLow = This wasn't tested for such temperatures.
