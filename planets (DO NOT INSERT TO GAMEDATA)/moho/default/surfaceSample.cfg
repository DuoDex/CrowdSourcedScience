		MohoSrfLanded = The sample shows signs of past volcanic activity.
		MohoSrfLanded = The sample shows signs of scorch marks and intense heat, but you already knew that.
		MohoSrfLanded = The sample is very brittle and is covered with micro-cracks. It suggests that a superheated atmosphere may have once existed here.
		MohoSrfLanded = The ground is made up of old lava flows, suggesting periods of intense volcanic activity.
		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks lying around seem to be ejecta from volcanic eruptions.
		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks all look the same to you. Wishing you had taken that geology course back on Kerbin, you try to break some stones by hitting them hard against each other. They seem to be very sturdy and don’t break at all.
		MohoSrfLanded = Ahah! You spot a familiar-looking rock a couple of meters away from you. It reminds you of the snack pack you’ve just eaten.
		MohoSrfLanded = Yup, its a chunk of Moho.
