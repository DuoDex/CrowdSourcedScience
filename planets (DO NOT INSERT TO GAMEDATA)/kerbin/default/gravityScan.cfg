		default = After reading the results, you think you finally understand the full gravity of the situation.
		default = You report your observations about this weighty situation.
		default = There are a lot of negative gravioli particles here. Wait...
		default = A positive gravioli particle approaches, but is tossed away at the last second.
		default = The scan indicates there is something pulling at the sensor.
		default = Recorded accurate measurements of gravitational forces in these conditions.
		default = Sensors failed! But this data will help to improve them, so send them home immediately!
		default = Gravity Reversal occurred for one thirty-third of a second. Minor damage. Major fear.
		default = The sensor is, for some reason, reading 4096 significant figures.
		default = You have no idea what these numbers mean.
		default = Oh boy, more numbers!
		SunFlyingLow = The sensor yells at you.

		MohoSrfLanded = Landing here has provided a very accurate and stable measure of gravitational forces.
		MohoSrfLanded = Moho’s gravity and density implies that a metal-rich core occupies at least 60% of the planet's mass, a figure twice as great as for Kerbin!

		EveSrfLanded = The gravity of Eve strongly supports your personal "Planet Core is a Black Hole" theory.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravitational field is very strong here. The sensor records detailed data about the local field.
		EveSrfLanded = So heavy... its weight level must be over 9000!
		EveSrfLanded = The sensor’s overload warning is on. It appears Eve’s gravity is almost too much.
		Gilly = The gravity is ridiculous. Playing ker-ball on Gilly might end up putting the ball in orbit.
		Gilly = The readings are so low that the margin of error still touches zero.
		GillyInSpace = You manage to get an accurate reading despite the overpowering pull from Eve.
		GillySrfLanded = With Gilly's low gravity, you now question why Jeb wanted to put Mainsails on the lander.

		GillySrfLanded = Peering very closely at the dial, you notice there's indeed some gravity here.
		GillySrfLanded = You have to tap the sensor a few times before it realizes that gravity is, in fact, present.
		GillySrfLanded = The instrument hardly recognizes the asteroid below.
		GillySrfLanded = Hey, is this thing on?
		GillySrfLanded = Are you sure the sensor’s even working? The numbers are so small they don’t register on the cheap LCD.
		GillySrfLanded = The team back at KSC will enjoy these detailed readings.
		GillySrfLanded = The gravioli detector reports that there is NO gravity on this dwarf asteroid… wait, there’s like 0.01 gravity units here.		
		KerbinInSpace = The sensor finds subtle changes in Kerbin’s gravitational field. The science team will want to see these readings!
		KerbinInSpace = The gravity seems to be incredibly high for a celestial body of this size. It must be composed of an extremely dense material.

		MinmusSrfLanded = The sensor takes detailed readings of the local gravity on Minmus.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The scan picks up the subtle changes in field caused by the orbit of the Mun. This data will provide valuable insight into the local system.
		DunaInSpace = The sensor passes over the mottled surface of Duna. Gravity appears lowest in the massive canyon that stretches across the surface.
		DunaSrfLanded = The gravity is high enough to walk normally but low enough for EVA packs to work like jetpacks. Colonizing here just got a lot more appealing.

		DresSrfLanded = This data suggests Dres is not as large as the other bodies orbiting the Sun.
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity in fine detail and records all variations.
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor is on the fritz again.
		MohoSrfLanded = The gravitational pull of this planet is high for one of its size. The core must be extremely dense.

		JoolInSpaceLow = You secure the sensor with a few more bolts just in case. It trembles in fear, but you give it a reassuring pat.
		LaytheInSpace = The sensor scans the gravity of Laythe. It helps hint at the diverse terrain under the water.
		LaytheSrfLanded = There does appear to be some gravity here.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You detect massive fluctuations as Jool tugs on the moon's surface.

		TyloSrfLanded = Confirmed: getting home will not be easy.
		TyloSrfLanded =Detailed scans hint at hollow spaces in the interior of the planet.
		Bop = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.
		BopInSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
		BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here…
		BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location… wait, it’s gone now.
		PolInSpace = The sensor picks up multiple layers under the surface of the planet.
		PolSrfLanded = There are roughly twice as many left-handed negative graviolis as right-handed ones here. That means something. Nobody knows what, though.
		PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol.
		EelooInSpace = Before you left Kerbin, the program director told you of the great gravity of your mission. It is clear to you now that he exaggerated.
		EelooInSpace = Though the surface appears to be smooth, there are fluctuations coming from beneath it.
		EelooSrfLanded = This planetoid has a small but significant gravitational force, perfect for extreme snowball fights.
		EelooSrfLanded = Gravity scans are very clear here. There is little influence from other bodies.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity scanner reports a low reading, very similar to that of the Mun. Do all moons have the same gravity? R&D notes the theory down, but they use a pencil just in case.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity is very low!
		IkeSrfLanded = You detect fluctuations in Duna’s tidal effect as it librates in the distance.
		SunInSpaceLow = The gravitational pull is very high. Maybe that's why the planets don't fly away?
		SunInSpaceLow = The manufacturer's manual for this instrument has classified readings in this range as "very unwise". There is a somewhat unhelpful footnote that the warranty does not cover melting.
		SunInSpaceLow = The readings are so far off the scale that the dial loops back around to 1.
		EveFlyingLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
		VallInSpaceHigh = You can feel some gravity already.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope. Why did we land here again?
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.
		BopSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
		MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.
		MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in. What a surprise!
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner can't decide which way is up.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The display reads "Error HL3". Upon consultation with the manual, you discover that this means the sensor can't find any gravity to scan.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner decides that the ship has more gravity than Gilly.
