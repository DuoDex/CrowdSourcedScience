		MohoSrfLanded = The racks holding the samples melt in a highly interesting fashion.
		MohoSrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials all seem to be posing, preparing for the scientists’ examination.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.

		KerbinInSpace = A frozen glowing squid has just floated out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You see a rubber duck float out of the Material Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The microgravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way.

		MunSrfLanded = For a moment, one of the materials reflects a black shape somewhere on the distant surface.
		MunSrfLanded = The fine dust of the Mun has intermixed with some of the samples. You have a sneaking suspicion that they'll never be able to get the lab clean again.

		DunaSrfLanded = Observing becomes somewhat difficult as red dust cakes over the camera lens.
		DunaSrfLanded = The samples appear to be permanently red. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		DunaSrfLanded = The computer processes the results. Its massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly... ominously... blinks.

		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Certain samples react explosively with Laythe's oceans. Or perhaps the sensor is reacting explosively? It's hard to tell.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The power supply begins to short out. Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!

		VallSrfLanded = Many of the samples freeze, or evaporate from the sample container.
		VallSrfLanded = The door freezes up before continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.
		VallSrfLanded = You hear a knocking coming from the inside of the materials bay, but good judgement keeps you from investigating further.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Goo looks very similar to peanut butter. Then you realize this isn't a Goo canister and someone got peanut butter all over your materials!

		PolSrfLanded = Small pieces of Pol cover the samples.
		PolSrfLanded = You hear a sneeze in the bay.
		EelooSrfLanded = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look away, and some of the materials shape into a dog.
		EelooSrfLanded = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.
		EelooSrfLanded = A strange green crystal has grown. Maybe KSC will know what to do with it.

		EelooSrfLanded = Most of the materials are frozen solid.
		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. Some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.
		EelooInSpace = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.
		EelooInSpace = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.

		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The lunar soil has mixed with one of the materials, producing a grey paste that is getting everywhere.

		MohoInSpaceLow = Some of the samples suggest Moho has a weak magnetic field.
		EveSrfLandedCraterLake = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!

		EveSrfLandedMountains = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
		DresInSpace = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples. Probably a micro-meteor or some swamp gas. You had nothing to do with it.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = The metal is metallic, the wood is wooden, the glass is glassy. If Tylo is going change any of this you will have to get closer.
		GillyInSpaceLow = It looks like someone's been trying to hide snacks in the Materials Lab.
