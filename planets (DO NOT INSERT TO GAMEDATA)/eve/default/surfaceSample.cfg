	{
		Eve = Oooooo. Purple!
		EveSrfLanded = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this colour falls as precipitation.
		EveSrfLanded = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it worth it? Sure! It's purple!
		EveSrfLanded = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.
		EveSrfLanded = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?
		EveSrfLanded = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.
		EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
		EveSrfLanded = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it just reflecting that color from its surroundings? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.
		EveSrfLanded = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.
		EveSrfLanded = I’ve come all this way for THIS?
		EveSrfLanded = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 kerbals.
		EveSrfSplashed = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
		EveSrfSplashed = The purple water dyes the suit pink.
		EveSrfSplashed = Further analysis will determine if this liquid is indeed grape-flavoured, as you hope it is.
		EveSrfSplashed = Johnny was a chemist's son, / But Johnny is no more; / What Johnny thought was H2O / was H2SO4.
		EveSrfSplashed = You try tasting your sample, and find that it is indeed not grape soda.
		EveSrfSplashed = This purplish liquid sample looks like your favourite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.
		EveSrfSplashed = You find traces of liquid Blutonium.
		EveSrfSplashed = This liquid looks an awful lot like mercury now that you've collected it in a bottle. You hope your suit is as waterproof as the manual promised.
		EveSrfSplashed = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin’s core.
