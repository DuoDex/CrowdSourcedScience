		EveSrfLanded = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
		EveSrfLanded = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
		EveSrfLanded = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.
		EveSrfLanded = Though this is an atmosphere, it's definitely not something you want to breathe.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
		EveSrfLanded = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.
		EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird colour.
		EveFlyingHigh = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Mission controls insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.
		EveFlyingHigh = The highly corrosive gasses start pocking and stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.
		EveFlyingHigh = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.
		EveFlyingHigh = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.
		EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of superheated water vapor.
		EveFlyingLow = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.
		EveFlyingLow = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?
		EveFlyingLow = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!
		EveFlyingLow = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingLow = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.
		EveFlyingLow = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingLow = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.
		EveFlyingLow = It's thick, purple, and full of hot air. What did you expect?
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel relieved that you have plenty of oxygen left in your tanks, wherever they are.
		EveSrfSplashed = Acidic vapors are eating away at the sensor.
