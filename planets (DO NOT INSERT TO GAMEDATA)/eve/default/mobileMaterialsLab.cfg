		EveInSpace = The materials bay, after an apparent deliberation, produces a liquid. It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
		EveInSpace = All samples turn purple out of fear.
		EveSrfLanded = The materials that have not melted are one by one starting to catch fire. This probably has implications for space suit design.
		EveSrfLanded = The samples appear torn between their allegiance to green and their new environment of purple. They turn an indecisive shade of blue.
		EveSrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if the samples have changed color, or if it's just the lighting.
		EveSrfSplashed = The oceans seem to be stripping the paint off of the lab's materials safety decals.
		EveSrfSplashed = The materials start to dissolve. The liquid here appears to be acidic.
		EveSrfSplashed = The gel samples begin to evaporate, making odd colored smoke. You suddenly wonder if this could be used to make colored exhaust.
		EveSrfSplashed = The radioactivity has caused the Blutonium samples to vaporise. Apart from that, everything is normal.
		EveSrfSplashed = Ten out of ten samples agree: The stuff below you is a liquid.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmosphere either polishes or strips the samples, depending on their composition.
		EveFlyingLow = The samples are torn out of the container by the pressure of the atmosphere. Perhaps Kerbtape wasn’t enough.
