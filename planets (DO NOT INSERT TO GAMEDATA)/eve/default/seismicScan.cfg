		EveSrfLanded = The scan yields a great deal of important information, but none of it says "purple."
		EveSrfLanded = The scan hints at Eve's crust structure.
		EveSrfLanded = The sensor has detected possible seismic activity below the surface.
		EveSrfLanded = The vibrations, though slight, might be enough to map the interior structure of the planet.
		EveSrfLanded = A strange echoing effect is apparent. It could be a sign of underground cavities buried deep beneath the surface.
