		EveSrfLanded = Readings are off the charts, literally. Engineers in Mission Control hastily append another sheet of printer paper to them.
		EveSrfLanded = The temperature is so hot that the thermometer wants to slap you in the face.
		EveSrfLanded = The data suggests a suitable temperature for frying kalamari.
		EveSrfLanded = Temperatures range between very cold and hot enough to boil water.
		EveSrfLanded = That’s far too pleasant to be right. Maybe if you jiggle the cord... aha! There it goes.
		EveSrfLanded = The liquid in the thermometer seems to be frothing angrily.
		EveSrfLanded = The temperature is a balmy purple.
		EveSrfLanded = You’re not sure if the temperature reading is accurate or if the gravity is so strong the mercury can’t rise properly...
		EveInSpaceLow = You detect a definite heat signature from the planet below.
		EveSrfSplashed = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.
		EveSrfSplashed = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.
		EveSrfSplashed = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.
