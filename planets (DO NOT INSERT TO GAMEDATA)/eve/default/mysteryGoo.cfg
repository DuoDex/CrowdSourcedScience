		EveInSpace = The Goo indicates to you that it would prefer a different travel destination.
		EveInSpace = The Goo has become rubbery and bounces around the container.
		EveInSpace = The Goo looks purple. Is it just the lighting, or did it actually change color?
		EveInSpace = The Goo is staring towards the planet. Is it homesick?
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo is also looking purple here. What else is new?
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo sits calmly bubbling away, showing no signs of being affected by a magnetic field. Maybe Eve releases gas from its surface to replace the atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks stressed. Perhaps it's under a lot of pressure?
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks very... purpley.
		EveSrfLanded = You look at The Goo and think that you see an image of a Kerbal. When you look back again, all you see is the standard routine of being crushed under the atmospheric pressure.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks very distressed.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo has completely flattened against the bottom of the canister. A tendril extends slowly towards you, as if to say, "Can we go home now?"
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo is dense and viscous and sticks itself to the bottom of the canister.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo has escaped into the purple liquid and seems to be waving goodbye as it floats away.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo now appears like a straw blown painting. It looks distinctly purple but so does everything else.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo appears to have merged with the liquid.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo has either completely disappeared or been bleached purple.
		EveSrfSplashed = The goo breaks free of the canister, excited for a swim. Upon contact with the purple liquid, however, it quickly returns and curls up in the corner.
