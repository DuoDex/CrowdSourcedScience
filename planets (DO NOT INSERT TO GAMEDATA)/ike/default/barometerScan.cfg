		IkeFlyingLow = There appears to be no atmosphere here.
		IkeSrfLanded = Barometer is quite a fun word, way more fun than what barometer actually does. Or these readings for that matter, which are just solid, round zeroes.
		IkeSrfLanded = The gauge reads nothing, even on the surface.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere. But there are very few moons with atmospheres, so what did you expect?
