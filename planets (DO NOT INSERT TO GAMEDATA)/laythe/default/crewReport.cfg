	RESULTS
	{
		LaytheInSpace = You look at the moon below and feel homesick.
		LaytheInSpace = You started daydreaming about being the captain of the Space Battleship 'Spirit of Kerbin', until being woken up by a beeping sound.
		LaytheInSpace = As the crew look down upon Laythe, they are reminded of home and the huge distance they have traveled.
		LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin. You wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
		LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You note the landmasses in your report.
		LaytheSrfLanded = After hearing the air is breathable, you open your space helmet, only to find that breathable does not mean odorless or pleasant.
		LaytheSrfLanded = One day we will have a permanent base here. One day.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The crew deliberates heavily on the correct way to pronounce 'Laythe'.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It appears that we are very much on the ground right now.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The ocean looks inviting. You realize that you forgot your swimsuit. Oh well, KSC would never have approved.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You suddenly realize that you forgot to bring your towel.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Looking at the map of Laythe to figure out which of the islands is the closest, you know it'll be a long swim for any chance of rescue.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As you look out the window, you see something glowing below you. You decide it's probably best to get to shore as soon as possible.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to have blocked most of Jool's radiation at this altitude. You hope your tan doesn't suffer as a result.
		LaytheFlyingLow = Are you sure we aren't on Kerbin?
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = The radiation here must be intense. You are glad the cockpit of your spacecraft is heavily shielded.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at Laythe, you begin to wonder whether Kerbin is the only planet harbouring life.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Your radiation instruments are showing some strange results. Perhaps Laythe has a magnetic field that is interacting with Jool's.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = Readings for alpha and beta radiation are low here, but there are still elevated readings for X-Rays and gamma radiation.
