	{
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!
		LaytheSrfLanded = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. You shouldn't volunteer to go out first without a helmet on however.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Breathing this probably wouldn’t kill you... immediately.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be made up of oxygen and nitrogen. You wonder at the high chlorine content, though.
		LaytheFlyingLow = There's Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and lots of water. You scribble down a note: "Invest in colonization program."
		LaytheFlyingLow = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photodissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
		LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
