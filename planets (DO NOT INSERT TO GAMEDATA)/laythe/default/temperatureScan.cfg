	{
		Laythe = The temperatures here are below water's freezing point. Clearly, the water here has odd characteristics.
		Laythe = The temperature fluctuates more than expected.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It is just above the freezing point of water here. A hot beverage would fit in well.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It’s quite cold here. You would definitely need some warm clothes if you were ever to walk around without your spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Temperatures are similar to those of Kerbin’s polar regions. The water hasn’t frozen, though, most probably due to the high salinity.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.
