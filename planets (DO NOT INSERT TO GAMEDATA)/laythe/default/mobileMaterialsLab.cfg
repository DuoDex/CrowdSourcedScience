		LaytheFlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. The color of the flame indicates the presence of oxygen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The materials suddenly gather by the window, looking at the surface below.
		LaytheFlyingLow = One sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Some of the samples spill and soak into the soil. You silently pray that the samples are sterile.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Certain samples react explosively with Laythe's oceans. Or perhaps the sensor is reacting explosively? It's hard to tell.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The power supply begins to short out. Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!
