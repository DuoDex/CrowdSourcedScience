		default = You find a kettle in the supplies container and start to beg mission control the permission to stop what you are doing and have a cup of tea.
		default = The vastness of space is mind-boggling. It's crazy how many puddings could be stored with the advent of high-capacity dessert storage devices.
		default = "My leg is so itchy. And why does my suit smell like anchovies... Wait a minute... Are we recording?!"
		default = You look out the window and wonder where the nearest fast-food is.
		default = You didn't know there was a "master alarm...?"
		default = The Master Alarm starts blinking. You kick the console and everything returns to normal.
		default = Mission Control denies your request to "Use the radio antenna to prank call the pizza place."
		default = Mission Control assures you (again!) that no, you cannot get any pizza delivered to you.

		default = Your mind wanders as mission control drones on about "Dell Ta Vee" and what that has to do with space travel.

		default = "...In T minus 2... 1... " *ding* "Mission Control: we have burritos."
		default = You take this opportunity to add a chapter to your ongoing "Harry Potman" fanfiction. Both of your followers will no doubt be excited to see how it develops.
		default = Mission control is concerned that the crew's new navigation plan is unsound. "Second star to the right and straight on till morning" is not a very specific vector.
		default = You detect television signals from Kerbin.
		default = A mysterious odor wafts from somewhere behind you in the capsule.
		default = Much to your dismay, a deep scan of the ship's systems indicate that there are no games installed on the flight computer.

		default = Suddenly you say, "Everybody do the flop!"
		default = You wonder about what would happen if you were to put a marshmallow on a stick in front of the rocket exhaust.

		default = “Testing … test … testing … is this thing on? Hey did you guys leave the mic on? I think it’s on right now! Is this transmitting? Yup, definitely transmitting. Let’s just go ahead and turn that off.”
		default = Nothing of great importance has happened just now.
		default = You hear a loud thud on the hull of the spacecraft. You look intently at your gauges and readings and confirm there is no serious damage to the space craft.
		default = You report that you could use more fuel and space on the spacecraft. You begin to contemplate why they call it a Spacecraft when there is hardly any space in here. It’s more like a sardine can.
