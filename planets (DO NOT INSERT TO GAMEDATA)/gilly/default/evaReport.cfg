	{
		Gilly = You wonder how awesome it would be to make a jump with a rover from the hills here.
		GillySrfLanded = If only the launchpad had been here instead of KSC, this whole space thing would've been so much easier. You make a note to berate the administrators back home over their poor choice.
		GillySrfLanded = "Wait... there's a planet below me? Does it even have gravity?"
		GillySrfLanded = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.
		GillySrfLanded = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = You balance yourself on your pinky finger and start doing pushups, only to find yourself slowly floating away.
		GillySrfLanded = Using your RCS systems for balance, you manage to walk along the surface using only two fingers.
		GillySrfLanded = We could really use some anchors here.
		GillySrfLanded = You try to walk, but instead go several meters into the air. It takes minutes before you float back down.
		GillySrfLanded = Walk very slowly... Oh no! You tripped.
		GillySrfLanded = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you’d brought an anchor.
		GillySrfLanded = You probably shouldn’t jump. You might not come back down.
		GillySrfLanded = One small step for Kerb, one giant leap for WHAAAAA!
		GillySrfLanded = That rock you threw is still going...
		GillySrfLanded = It takes a while to get used to the idea of kilometer-long jumps.
		GillySrfLanded = You think you can jetpack into orbit ten times over.
		GillySrfLanded = No gravity? No problem!
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Looking down, you see the two moons of Eve. As you are about to record the new satellite, you realise that one of the two is, in fact, a speck of dust.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You try to touch a passing peak. KSC tells you to go back into your capsule and raise your damn orbit.
