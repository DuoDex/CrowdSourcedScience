		GillySrfLanded = The chondrules in the regolith remind you of white chocolate chip brownies.
		GillySrfLanded = You have a hard time picking up some dust samples as it flies out of your scoop and into the sky.
		GillySrfLanded = You could almost fit this 'moon' into the container.
		GillySrfLanded = You grab a large boulder, at least twice your size, only to realize that it won't fit in the ship. You casually toss it off to the side and pick a more reasonable sample.
		GillySrfLanded = You accidentally toss the sample into the air and it sails off into space, so you grab another one.
		GillySrfLanded = This sample may contain the secrets of the formation of the Solar System! Or it might just be a bit of dirt and rocks...
		GillySrfLanded = Taking a surface sample in low gravity is kinda tricky. As you dig the shovel in, the reaction force sends you flying upwards.
		GillySrfLanded = Unfortunately, the surface is composed of loose rock of various sizes. It looks like you'll have to wait a while longer for that baked potato.
		GillySrfLanded = The surface gives away easily and you have a hard time keeping the sample in the container due to the low gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = Carborundum - clear evidence that Gilly was once subjected to a whole lot of “boom boom.”
		GillySrfLanded = Your Geiger counter clicks too many times to warrant keeping this.
		GillySrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It looks so dull that you throw it away in irritation. It soars into the skies, disappearing over horizon. You wonder if it made an orbit until it hits you in the head from behind.
		GillySrfLanded = You pick up a rock, but you’re so strong that the rock flies into space.
		GillySrfLanded = As you lift the rock, the dust underneath it reaches escape velocity.
