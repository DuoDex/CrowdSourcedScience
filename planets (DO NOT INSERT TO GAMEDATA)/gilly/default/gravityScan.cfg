	RESULTS
	{
		Gilly = The gravity is ridiculous. Playing ker-ball on Gilly might end up putting the ball in orbit.
		Gilly = The readings are so low that the margin of error still touches zero.
		GillyInSpace = You manage to get an accurate reading despite the overpowering pull from Eve.
		GillySrfLanded = With Gilly's low gravity, you now question why Jeb wanted to put Mainsails on the lander.
		GillySrfLanded = The needle on the gravity sensor seems to have moved about half a millimeter.
		GillySrfLanded = Peering very closely at the dial, you notice there's indeed some gravity here.
		GillySrfLanded = You have to tap the sensor a few times before it realizes that gravity is, in fact, present.
		GillySrfLanded = The instrument hardly recognizes the asteroid below.
		GillySrfLanded = Hey, is this thing on?
		GillySrfLanded = Are you sure the sensor’s even working? The numbers are so small they don’t register on the cheap LCD.
		GillySrfLanded = The team back at KSC will enjoy these detailed readings.
		GillySrfLanded = The gravioli detector reports that there is NO gravity on this dwarf asteroid… wait, there’s like 0.01 gravity units here.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner can't decide which way is up.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The display reads "Error HL3". Upon consultation with the manual, you discover that this means the sensor can't find any gravity to scan.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner decides that the ship has more gravity than Gilly.
