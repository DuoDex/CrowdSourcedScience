		EelooSrfLanded = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look away, and some of the materials shape into a dog.
		EelooSrfLanded = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.
		EelooSrfLanded = A strange green crystal has grown. Maybe KSC will know what to do with it.
		EelooSrfLanded = All of the materials have frozen solid, except for one which has mysteriously caught fire.
		EelooSrfLanded = Most of the materials are frozen solid.
		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. Some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.
		EelooInSpace = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.
		EelooInSpace = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.
