		EelooSrfLanded = The only atmosphere here seems to be lying around in frozen lumps.
		EelooSrfLanded = A lot of energy was expended to bring an atmospheric package all the way out here for nothing.
		EelooSrfLanded = The dust from landing is tricking the sensor into thinking there's an atmosphere here.
