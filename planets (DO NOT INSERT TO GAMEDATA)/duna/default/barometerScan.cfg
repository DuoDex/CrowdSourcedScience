		DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.
		DunaFlyingLow = Even the barometer isn’t sure how to interpret the readings.
		DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads "Gasping for air!" You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.
		DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere is pretty thin even at the surface. You don't think parachutes or wings would work very well here.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it’s still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
		DunaSrfLanded = There isn’t much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
