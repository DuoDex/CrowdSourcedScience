		DunaSrfLanded = Not much interesting happens when you run the seismic scan. Maybe the planet is geologically dead, or perhaps it is just having a nap.
		DunaSrfLanded = The seismograph barely responds. If this planet ever had seismic activity, it doesn't anymore.
		DunaSrfLanded = The instrument detects some very faint tremors.
		DunaSrfLanded = The readings indicate an iron core. This planet might have had a functioning geodynamo in the distant past.
		DunaSrfLanded = The planet doesn't seem to have much seismic activity.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sensor gives insight to the seismic activity of Duna.
		DunaSrfLanded = There does not appear to be significant seismic activity on the planet. It is possible that it is no longer geologically active.
