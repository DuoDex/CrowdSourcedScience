		DunaInSpace = The planet looks very orange, which reminds you of the orange chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?
		DunaInSpace = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
		DunaInSpace = As you orbit the planet, you pick up what appears to be a TV signal from Kerbin. It's so badly distorted that you can't make neither head nor tail of it.
		DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.
		DunaInSpace = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light…
		DunaInSpace = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light… No, no... that’s a face.
		DunaInSpace = You gaze at the planet, and realize you'll have no problems keeping your night vision.
		DunaInSpace = You really like Duna. It reminds you of chocolate pancakes.
		DunaInSpace = Can it be kerbiformed?
		DunaFlyingHigh = You look out, and note the massive geological features. It is possible that Duna was once very geologically active.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Very small piles of fine grain red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingHigh = There seems to be something resembling a face on the surface of a planet, but it's only a play of light and shadow.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's surface seems to be covered with dunes. You remark that the planet was aptly-named.
		DunaSrfLanded = "It's extremely red; over."
		DunaSrfLanded = Dark spots on the surface of Duna were once thought to be the darkness of vegetation growing near the poles as the seasons change. It is now known that the dark coloration is in fact caused by seasonal dust storms.
		DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You notice you are coming in close to the red planet, and you secretly hope to find intelligent life!
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The crew is concerned that the planet is "too red". Mission control does not believe this is a good reason to go home.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Is it a big tomato?
		DunaFlyingLow = You shiver in your seat. Your thoughts turn to the glowing warmth of re-entry into Kerbin's atmosphere and you start to miss your family.
