		DunaInSpace = The sensor passes over the mottled surface of Duna. Gravity appears lowest in the massive canyon that stretches across the surface.
		DunaSrfLanded = The gravity is high enough to walk normally but low enough for EVA packs to work like jetpacks. Colonizing here just got a lot more appealing.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sensor performs a detailed and calibrated sweep of local gravity on Duna.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sensor is able to record the effects of Ike as it orbits Duna.
