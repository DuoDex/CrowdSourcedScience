		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.
