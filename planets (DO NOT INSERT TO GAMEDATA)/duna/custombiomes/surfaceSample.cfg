		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The soil here is like tundra, dirt mixed with ice crystals, with a thin layer of fresh white frost on top.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = The ground here appears to be mostly basalt from ancient lava flows, with a thin coating of sand and dust.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The floor of this depression seems to be composed of sedimentary rocks.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = You pick up some loose stones that look to have been part of a landslide.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = You chip away at the hard basalt with your rock hammer and eventually get a good sample.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = You take a surface sample, hoping to determine if water was once flowing here.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = Layers of darker sediment have been deposited here by long-dead streams and the constant wind.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The valley floor is covered with layers of sediment laid down by the wind - and possibly water, long ago...
