	{
		Bop = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.
		BopInSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
		BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here…
		BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location… wait, it’s gone now.
