		BopSrfLanded = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.
		BopSrfLanded = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.
		BopSrfLanded = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
		BopSrfLanded = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it’s probably just your suit being out of order.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there’s something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.
		BopInSpace = The moon strikingly resembles a potato.
