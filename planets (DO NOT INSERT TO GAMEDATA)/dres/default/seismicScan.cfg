		DresSrfLanded = There's no internal movement. Aside from the impacts of meteors, the needle never moves.
		DresSrfLanded = You tap the ground a few times. Yep, it's on. This planet is just dead.
		DresSrfLanded = Seismic sensors show that this dwarf planet has little geologic activity. You wonder if detonating a fuel tank would somehow remedy the situation.
		DresSrfLanded = This planet appears to be seismically inactive.
		DresSrfLanded = Periodic bombardments appear to be causing slight vibrations and surface quakes.
		DresSrfLanded = Changes in the speed of vibrations hint to differing materials under the surface.
