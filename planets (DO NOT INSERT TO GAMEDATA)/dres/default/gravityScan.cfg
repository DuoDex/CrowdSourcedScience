		DresInSpace = The sensor sweeps the surface and finds the gravity to be quite low for a planet.
		DresSrfLanded = The gravity is so low, you wonder if Dres is a planet at all!
		DresSrfLanded = This data suggests Dres is not as large as the other bodies orbiting the Sun.
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity in fine detail and records all variations.
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor is on the fritz again.
