		DresSrfLanded = The computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works.
		DresSrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed to the environment.
		DresSrfLanded = The samples are quiet. Too quiet.
		DresInSpaceHigh = The objects are still floating around and making a mess, though some of them have grouped together and occasionally you see a spark between them.
		DresInSpace = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples. Probably a micro-meteor or some swamp gas. You had nothing to do with it.
