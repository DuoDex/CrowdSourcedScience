		DunaSrfLanded = There does not appear to be significant seismic activity on the planet. It is possible that it is no longer geologically active.

		BopSrfLanded = There are subtle vibrations that cannot be explained by Bop's physical characteristics.
		BopSrfLanded = The planet gives off steady quakes which grow in intensity as Vall passes; as it leaves, they settle down again. This would be expected if the other moons did the same.

		BopSrfLanded = Among all the shakes and jitters, you notice a continual pulsing pattern. It makes you feel uneasy.

		BopSrfLanded = A seismic event occurs in the distance, as if a large object had just impacted the surface.
		BopSrfLanded = Some vibrations have been detected under your vessel. You start to think about the creepy stories your friends have told you.
		BopSrfLanded = Bop seems to be impacted often... what is hitting it?
		PolSrfLanded = After squinting at the device, you can still see vibrations from your landing on the screen, circling the (very tiny) globe.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder if repeated rocket launches have caused the ground to become unstable.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Laythe shows some very important seismic activity. You're not sure the craft can survive a tsunami, but at least it keeps the moon temperate.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments. Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The needle jumps and shakes violently; moments later, you hear a distant explosion. Looks like somebody let Bill into the cafeteria kitchen again.

		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The periodic moonquakes seem clear and easy to read here. The science team will want to see these numbers.
		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The readings here are solid, but they might be better if we could do them in a canyon.
		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The scans indicate a large series of quakes incoming! Oh wait, your hand brushed the sensor. False alarm.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The shallow water echoes vibrations from the muddy soil below.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The ground appears to have many small fractures from the multiple impacts, causing slight distortions in readings.

		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = A boulder rolling down the neighboring slope interferes with your readings.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = There's a lot of static on the sensor feed. Are we sliding down the hill?
