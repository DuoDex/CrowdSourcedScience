		default = You hear a loud thud on the hull of the spacecraft. You look intently at your gauges and readings and confirm there is no serious damage to the space craft.
		default = You report that you could use more fuel and space on the spacecraft. You begin to contemplate why they call it a Spacecraft when there is hardly any space in here. It’s more like a sardine can.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder why you experienced over 3 gs when the rocket was moved to the pad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Just a heads’ up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Are we there yet?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = “Wait! Let me out, I changed my mind!”
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Check ignition and may Von Kerman’s love be with you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder what that nasty smell is. Either there is a serious propellant leak or Bob had burritos for lunch. Again.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you’re in space.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You think that you should be flying the craft instead of making boring logs.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a piece of paper from your notepad and draw a spaceplane on it.

		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = “Clear Right. Clear Left. We’re good here. Ground control come in. Over.”
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Reporting from the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of traffic, because I don't think we ever got the clearance to be here.

		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay, just hallucinating.
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The mountains rise up from the grasslands of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from up here.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look out the window hoping to find a tasty cake until you realize somebody made a slight spelling error in the flight plan.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look around and see no water for miles. You begin to wonder why you didn’t bring more.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You wonder if crashing here would create a glass crater. Then you realize how cool that would be.

		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Moose!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Please don’t land here, please don’t land here, please don’t land here...

		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You wonder if it’s safe to drink the water.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = The water looks so peaceful from here.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You imagine all the wonderful creatures that live below the surface that would probably eat you. Or at least brush up against your leg while swimming.
		KerbinInSpace = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpace = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.

		KerbinInSpace = Agoraphobia sets in...
		KerbinInSpace = Bound for the stars.
		KerbinInSpace = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your vehicle they had once held in place.
		KerbinInSpace = Your slide rule breaks, and you begin to search for your backup before realizing that you don't know how to use a slide rule anyway.
		KerbinInSpace = You're in space and not dead. The crew and Flight Control have agreed that it's indeed a big step forward.
		KerbinInSpace = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
		KerbinInSpace = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
		KerbinInSpace = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
		KerbinInSpace = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.
		KerbinInSpace = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to microgravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
		KerbinInSpace = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like my globe!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Hey, I can see Jeb's Ego from here!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!"

		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.

		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in, from space!”
		KerbinInSpace = This is why we need fancy suits, huh?

		KerbinInSpace = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there’s nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpace = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
		KerbinInSpace = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
		KerbinInSpace = Let’s engage Warp Drive… wait, we don’t have Warp Drive?
		KerbinInSpace = Everything looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here.”

		KerbinInSpace = It’s time to leave the capsule... right?
		KerbinInSpace = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out -- maybe ankle-deep -- and the water seems inviting.
		Mun = You see a great sphere of mouldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the Mün.
		Mun = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.
		MunInSpace = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
		MunInSpace = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
		MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.

		MunInSpace = Wasn’t there an opera written about this once?
		MunInSpace = You don’t know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be… interesting.

		MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
		MunInSpaceHigh = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal’s.
		Minmus = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...
		MinmusInSpace = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if it’s possible to EVA to the surface and back.
		MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
		MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface…
		MinmusInSpace = Well, it’s certainly much smaller in person.
		MinmusInSpace = Jetpacking down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
		MinmusInSpace = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.
		GillyInSpace = Yup. It's tiny.
		GillyInSpace = A rock so little must have very little gravity. Next time, you'll bring a golf club.
		GillyInSpace = How cute! Despite its potato-like appearance, Gilly is an adorable little asteroid.
		GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. You bet you could jetpack down there.
		GillyInSpace = “I didn’t know they made them this small.”
		GillyInSpace = You wonder if anything would have a TWR of less than one here.
		GillyInSpace = What is this, a moon for ants?
		GillyInSpace = This place looks a bit boring. You start calculating what it would take to deorbit it into Eve, until your calculator gives you a NaN error. Flight Control refuses to do calculations for you.
		GillyInSpace = In retrospect, you imagined it to be bigger.
		GillyInSpace = It looks small and not very tasty.
		GillyInSpace = It looks like a potato. You are starting to feel very hungry.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You look down to the surface. It's so close! Of course you don't want to end up lithobraking on those hills by accident, but at this speed it probably wouldn't be that bad.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You think you can stick your arm out and touch the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but you are afraid that your first step will launch you right off the surface.

		GillySrfLanded = You feel no change in gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = You feel a surge in gravity. Mentioning nothing to KSC, you put on your brown pants.
		Moho = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.
		MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
		MohoInSpace = You ponder the mystery of where Moho’s atmosphere went. You’re glad it doesn’t have one anymore, because that would make coming back really hard.
		MohoInSpace = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
		MohoSrfLanded = It appears the heat shielding is melting. The Kerbals are sweating and hot.
		MohoSrfLanded = The crew considers which snacks would taste best if cooked.

		Eve = What smells like purple?
		Eve = That is definitely a deep commitment to purple.

		EveSrfSplashed = Even though your suit should be airtight, you swear that the capsule reeks faintly of nail polish remover.
		EveSrfSplashed = As you look out at the sea, it's purple color reminds you of your favorite soft drink.
		EveSrfSplashed = You see the purple liquid that is Eve´s ocean leak into the capsule. You get the suspicion that you may be in big trouble.
		EveSrfSplashed = Vile lakes shimmer beneath the crushing atmosphere.
		EveSrfSplashed = This reminds you of a time you saw a man get trapped in a vat of grape soda. Unfortunately, you can't drink your way out of this one.
		EveSrfSplashed = After looking through the window, you inform mission control you figured out where all the grape soda from the break room fridge keeps going.
		EveSrfSplashed = A couple mission controllers assure you that's grape juice outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins peeling the paint off the ship.
		EveSrfSplashed = You're pretty sure this *isn't* grape juice.
		EveSrfSplashed = We’re bouncing a bit too much here.
		EveSrfSplashed = The ocean is feeling a bit too cold…
		EveSrfSplashed = Short circuit in Wire Five!
		DunaInSpace = The planet looks very orange, which reminds you of the orange chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?
		DunaInSpace = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
		DunaInSpace = As you orbit the planet, you pick up what appears to be a TV signal from Kerbin. It's so badly distorted that you can't make neither head nor tail of it.
		DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.

		DresInSpace = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
		DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown, with a few craters.
		DresInSpaceLow = It's very grey and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better grey-resistant landing legs.
		DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
		DresSrfLanded = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mün. Wait.
		DresSrfLanded = It is exactly as grey and icy as expected. Not a bit of grey less, not a bit of ice more.
		DresSrfLanded = You were right… it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.
		Jool = We're very far from home.
		JoolInSpace = Captain's log: we are out of snacks.
		JoolInSpace = As you look down upon the great green planet, you think you can see a stirring of the clouds far, far below.
		JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below. They seem to go on forever, endlessly swirling into each other.
		JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color. More planets should be this color.
		JoolInSpace = You wonder if orange juice here is green.
		JoolInSpace = You see three big moons and two little ones. You want to land on them all.

		JoolFlyingHigh = It's more than disconcerting to see clouds in all directions.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You see a massive lightning bolt in the far off clouds. You nervously ask Mission Control if the ship is rated for that kind of discharge.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The planet before you resembles nothing so much as a giant tennis ball. Perhaps it has fuzz that can be harvested to build a space elevator?

		JoolFlyingHigh = You wonder if you will live to see the next hour.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You hope the aerobrake won’t be an aero landing.

		LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You note the landmasses in your report.
		LaytheSrfLanded = After hearing the air is breathable, you open your space helmet, only to find that breathable does not mean odorless or pleasant.

		LaytheSrfLanded = The crew deliberates heavily on the correct way to pronounce 'Laythe'.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It appears that we are very much on the ground right now.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.

		TyloInSpace = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
		TyloInSpace = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
		TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered than the other.
		TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there...
		TyloInSpace = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesn’t have an atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity is quite heavy and reminds you of home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You can't walk a few meters without your face becoming friends with the surface. It is a little agitating.
		TyloSrfLanded = I was expecting a bounce in my step. Maybe my springs aren't working.
		TyloSrfLanded = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.
		BopInSpace = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
		BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
		BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
		BopInSpace = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because you’ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
		BopInSpace = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can’t help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.

		BopSrfLanded = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.
		BopSrfLanded = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.

		Eeloo = As you stare down at the splintered, lifeless surface, a question forms in your mind: "Was this really worth it?"
		EelooInSpace = The crew look out towards the frozen ice ball Eeloo, and are momentarily lost for words. Few of Kerbalkind have made it this far from home, and the courage, determination, and drive their species has to put them here dawns on everyone. Their thoughts are profound and humble, that so few are supported by so many.
		EelooInSpace = It reminds you of a snowball. Is it winter already?
		EelooInSpace = Now this is an icy planet. You start imagining epic snowball fights in microgravity.
		EelooInSpace = You note that the capsule is not equipped with central heating, and Mission Control informs you this is because you were meant to go to Moho. This does not instill you with confidence.

		EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other planets nearby. You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe you should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.

		EelooInSpace = I feel like we could go anywhere. Let’s go. Like, now. Really, anywhere.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look out of the capsule and can't find Kerbin. What has mission control gotten you into this time?

		VallSrfLanded = Everything in the ship just bounced, that was one heck of a quake!
		VallSrfLanded = Quakes rattle tools and loose gear every few minutes.
		JoolFlyingLow = You can feel the green all around you now. This is awesome.
		JoolFlyingLow = This seems like a situation Jebediah would like to be in, just with more SRBs and explosions.
		JoolFlyingLow = As you look up through the stormy green clouds, it strikes you that maybe flying that low in Jool's atmosphere wasn't such a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = The craft is shaking and feels very unstable.
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize you are not a probe.

		JoolFlyingLow = You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
		JoolFlyingLow = Landing on Jool, eh? Why not?
		JoolFlyingLow = Still no sign of a surface. Perhaps if you flew even lower?
		MunFlyingHigh = You wonder if you'll be able to order pizza from here.

		LaytheSrfSplashed = As you look out the window, you see something glowing below you. You decide it's probably best to get to shore as soon as possible.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's surface seems to be covered with dunes. You remark that the planet was aptly-named.
		DunaSrfLanded = "It's extremely red; over."
		DunaSrfLanded = Dark spots on the surface of Duna were once thought to be the darkness of vegetation growing near the poles as the seasons change. It is now known that the dark coloration is in fact caused by seasonal dust storms.
		DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You notice you are coming in close to the red planet, and you secretly hope to find intelligent life!

		EveFlyingHigh = The wind and crew are screaming.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It feels strangely dangerous out there. Mission control insists it's safe, but you don't think they would know very well.
