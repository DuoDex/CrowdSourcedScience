		VallSrfLanded = As you dig into the blue ice, a particularly nasty quake sends your shovel flying. Perhaps you shouldn't dig any deeper...
		VallSrfLanded = Strangely, some of the ice on the surface seems significantly fresher than the rest.
		VallSrfLanded = The icy crystals show signs of shock and sharp temperature change at some point in the past.
		VallSrfLanded = After crushing some of the surface ice into a snow-cone and getting permission from mission control for an experiment, you find it doesn't taste particularly nice.
		VallSrfLanded = You chip away at the frozen surface and deposit some blue material in a container.
		VallSrfLanded = You dig around in the surface and find some beautiful green and blue crystal structures. They remind you of home, but you're unable to pick out Kerbin from the mass of twinkling lights.
		VallInSpace = This reminds you of Minmus, only bubblegum flavor...
