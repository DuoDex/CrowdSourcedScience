		DresInSpace = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
		DresInSpace = Looking down you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep. Too bad there’s no atmosphere, because you’d like to parachute down there.
		DresInSpace = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
		DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown, with a few craters.
		DresInSpaceLow = It's very grey and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better grey-resistant landing legs.
		DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
		DresSrfLanded = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mün. Wait.
		DresSrfLanded = It is exactly as grey and icy as expected. Not a bit of grey less, not a bit of ice more.
		DresSrfLanded = You were right… it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.
