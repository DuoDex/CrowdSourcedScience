		LaytheSrfLandedShores = Is the mercury still there?
        LaytheSrfLandedShores = The temperature is very similar to that of a refrigerator on steroids, lots of them.
        LaytheFlyingLowShores = Kerbol is small but bright. The cockpit glass is very cold when you touch it.
        LaytheFlyingHigh = The thermometer is near -40c. That's as cold as the Kerbin South Pole!
        LaytheInSpaceLow = You forgot to cap your drink and it floated away. When you licked up the spill, your tongue froze to the radio panel. Mission Control asked if you were under attack by aliens.
