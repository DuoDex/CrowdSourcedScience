		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil here contains no immediately identifiable organic chemicals.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You run the sand through your fingers and suddenly feel thirsty.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Sand is all over this moon. A shame it's not warmer...
		LaytheSrfLanded = You find particles of volcanic ash in the sand. Perhaps you should avoid eating them.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin's beaches, but it's less dense and darker in colour.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Small pebbles you've found look to be shaped by water.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil contains a lot of silica and feels very rough.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to form a castle out of the soil. For science, of course.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Thirsty from your long trip, you take a sip of the sample, only to find that it's the most awful water you ever tasted.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You go to sneak a sip of the sample, only to be nearly overwhelmed by the unpleasant odor. You spend the next few minutes recovering, wondering what possessed you to open your helmet.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The liquid filling these basins seems to be different than Kerbin's.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample sticks to your suit. You wonder if Mission Control is going to charge you for the dry cleaning.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The liquid, though definitely water, contains impurities that seem to help it maintain a liquid state at these temperatures.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You manage to take a sip of local water through the oxygen supply tube. It definitely looks like water, acts like water, smells like water and... it does not taste like water at all. You hope you have medicine on the ship.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = This sample seems to have all the basic compounds required for life.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You try a drink. It feels like a cold glacier and tastes like... well, tap water.
