		LaytheSrfLanded = You find particles of volcanic ash in the sand. Perhaps you should avoid eating them.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin's beaches, but it's less dense and darker in color.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Small pebbles you've found look to be shaped by water.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil contains a lot of silica and feels very rough.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to form a castle out of the soil. For science, of course.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil here contains some ores that looks like cronstedtite.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The liquid filling these basins seems to be different than Kerbin's.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample sticks to your suit. You wonder if Mission Control is going to charge you for the dry cleaning.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The liquid, though definitely water, contains impurities that seem to help it maintain a liquid state at these temperatures.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You manage to take a sip of local water through the oxygen supply tube. It definitely looks like water, acts like water, smells like water and... it does not taste like water at all. You hope you have medicine on the ship.
