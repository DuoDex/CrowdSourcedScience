		LaytheSrfLanded = You feel drunk because of the thin air. Mission Control asks you to put your helmet back on.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You wonder if you could swim to the next island from here.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You are glad to see the solid ground, but it seems that after such a long journey you almost forgot how to walk.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You are sorely tempted to remove your helmet.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Can I take off my spacesuit?
		LaytheSrfLanded = You realize that you forgot to bring sunscreen.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You feel comfortable, back at Kerbin after such a long sleep. Wait a minute...
		LaytheSrfLanded = You search the sky, hoping to see Jool.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Gazing around the landscape, you feel very homesick.
		LaytheSrfLanded = There might be good diving on this planet. Unfortunately, Mission Control did not pack any flippers.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It is much colder here than the scan from orbit suggested.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You feel a slight tremor. Perhaps you should have landed on that OTHER island.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet's protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe Kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it's because of lower oxygen content.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air looks tolerable and the water looks very inviting. A beautiful place to be!
		LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The low land to water ratio and sedate water cycle of Laythe combine to give its oceans low salinity. You're forced to constantly swim to keep afloat.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could swim to the nearest island.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You realise that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As much as you'd like to find life, the only green wiggling creature here is in a spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You attempt to drink some water. Then you remember the co-worker who died after ordering some "H2O too".
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You tread water. Perhaps you should have chosen a drier landing spot.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Swimming is really hard in these suits you know.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Your Geiger Counter is emitting a continuous hum. Time to flee.
		LaytheFlyingLow = You find that changes in your environment oddly turn your thoughts rapidly from desserts towards life insurances.
		LaytheFlyingLow = Now I really wish I had brought that parachute.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = As you gaze down upon the flowing waters of Laythe, you discover that you need a toilet.
