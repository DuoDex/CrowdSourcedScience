		LaytheSrfLanded = The barometer predicts rain.
		LaytheSrfLanded = For a couple of seconds you think the device is still displaying readings taken on Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The readings are almost the same as on a sunny beach back home. It makes you feel like going for a swim.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is a bit lower than on Kerbin. You are unsure if that makes it more fun or not.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is lower than on Kerbin, but you don't think seasoned mountaineers would have any trouble adapting to it.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You contemplate dunking the scanner to see if it can measure depth, but Mission Control says that will void the warranty.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Atmospheric pressure at sea level is quite high, but still less than on Kerbin. Well, it's a moon, give it a break!
		LaytheFlyingLow = The pressure seems higher over the water.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarified, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is unusually dense.
