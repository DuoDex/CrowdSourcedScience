		LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is lower than on Kerbin, but you don't think seasoned mountaineers would have any trouble adapting to it.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Atmospheric pressure at sea level is quite high, but still less than on Kerbin. Well, it's a moon, give it a break!
		LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarefied, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.
