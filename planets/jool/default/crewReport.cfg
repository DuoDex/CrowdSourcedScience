		JoolFlyingLow = You can feel the green all around you now. This is awesome.
		JoolFlyingLow = This seems like a situation Jebediah would like to be in, just with more SRBs and explosions.
		JoolFlyingLow = As you look up through the stormy green clouds, it strikes you that maybe flying that low in Jool's atmosphere wasn't such a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = The craft is shaking and feels very unstable.
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize you are not a probe.
		JoolFlyingLow = Your aerobraking attempt has turned into an aero landing. Was this part of the plan?
		JoolFlyingLow = Mission Control asks for a report, but all you can picture is a giant valedictory explosion.
		JoolFlyingLow = You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
		JoolFlyingLow = Landing on Jool, eh? Why not?
		JoolFlyingLow = Still no sign of a surface. Perhaps if you flew even lower?
		JoolFlyingHigh = While observing from the window you get startled as Jool seems to look back at you! After a moment of confusion you find out that it was your face reflecting from the window and comment on the screams to have been "only radio chatter".
		JoolFlyingHigh = As the craft flies through the dense green clouds, it slows down dramatically. Just don't get stuck.
		JoolFlyingHigh = It's more than disconcerting to see clouds in all directions.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You see a massive lightning bolt in the far off clouds. You nervously ask Mission Control if the ship is rated for that kind of discharge.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The planet before you resembles nothing so much as a giant tennis ball. Perhaps it has fuzz that can be harvested to build a space elevator?
		JoolFlyingHigh = You look out the window and are amazed by the view.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You wonder if you will live to see the next hour.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You hope the aerobrake wonâ€™t be an aero landing.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You wonder if orange juice here is green.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The green color of the atmosphere reminds you of the soft grass of Kerbin. Sort of.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You note just how big Jool is, and try not to think about how small it makes you feel.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The massive size of the Van Allen radiation belts is ripping electrons from the ship's hull. You carefully avoid the walls, avoiding to be zapped with the mother of all static discharges.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Maybe you'd be able to get a sample of metallic hydrogen before the inevitable crunch?
		JoolInSpaceLow = The green orb is looking very big now.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = You see three big moons and two little ones. You want to land on them all.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Captain's log: "We are out of snacks."
		JoolInSpaceHigh = As you look down upon the great green planet, you think you can see a stirring of the clouds far, far below.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = We're very far from home.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Glancing out the viewport, you see a gray disc blitz by. You start to think you are not alone.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = As you ponder at the planet's hue you are reminded that green is the color preferred most by geniuses.
