		JoolFlyingLow = The samples are running around in circles.
		JoolFlyingLow = One of the samples is panicking.
		JoolFlyingLow = The pressure of the Jool's atmosphere is so high that a few of the samples have begun fusing together.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Jool's immense gravity is pulling the materials towards one side of the container.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we did science. And we're still here.
