		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
		DunaFlyingLowLowlands = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into... *ahem.*
		DunaFlyingHighLowlands = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also higher.
