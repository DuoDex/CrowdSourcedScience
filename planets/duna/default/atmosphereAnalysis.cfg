		DunaSrfLanded = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
		DunaSrfLanded = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaSrfLanded = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
		DunaSrfLanded = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer say the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
		DunaSrfLanded = The carbon dioxide in the air is thick enough that it could be harvested for plants in greenhouses. Wait, what?
		DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
		DunaSrfLanded = 255. Definitely 255.
		DunaFlyingLow = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
		DunaFlyingLow = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingLow = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into... *ahem.*
		DunaFlyingLow = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
		DunaFlyingLow = Much of the atmosphere is dust that's blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also higher.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
