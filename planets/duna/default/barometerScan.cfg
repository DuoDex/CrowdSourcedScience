		DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads: "Gasping for air". You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.
		DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it's still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
		DunaSrfLanded = There isn't much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
		DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingLow = Even the barometer isn't sure how to interpret the readings.
