		DunaSrfLanded = You wouldn't know it by looking, but its actually really cold out here.
		DunaSrfLanded = The thin air is colder than anything you'd find on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna is colder than you expected.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna is awfully cold for being so red.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air is cold. The atmosphere must not support a strong greenhouse effect.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck.
		DunaInSpace = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
		DunaFlyingLow = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise a kid. Matter of fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
