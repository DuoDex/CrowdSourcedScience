		DunaSrfLandedPoles = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
