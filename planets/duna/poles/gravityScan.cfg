		DunaSrfLandedPoles = Picking up a kerbin-sized hunk of ice is easy. If you entered a strongkerbal contest remotely, you would win gold!
		DunaInSpaceLowPoles = There doesn't seem to be any gravity here. You grab a towel that is floating by and stow it away.
		DunaInSpaceHighPoles = Doing a cartwheel takes no effort. You accidentally hit a switch while spinning, hopefully it didn't do anything.
