		MohoSrfLanded = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.
		MohoInSpaceLow = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
		MohoInSpaceLow = After some arguments with mission control you come to the conclusion that Moho is a giant cookie.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
