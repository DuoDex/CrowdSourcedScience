		MohoSrfLanded = It appears the heat shielding is melting. The Kerbals are sweating and hot.
		MohoSrfLanded = The crew considers which snacks would taste best if cooked.
		MohoSrfLanded = You haven't been this hot since that day in training when your suit caught fire. You worry about it happening again.
		MohoSrfLanded = Sure is hot in here.
		MohoSrfLanded = Jeb wants to know if a rover would powerslide here. Badly.
		MohoInSpaceLow = You ponder the mystery of where Moho’s atmosphere went. You’re glad it doesn’t have one anymore, because that would make coming back really hard.
		MohoInSpaceLow = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.
