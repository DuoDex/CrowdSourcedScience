		MohoInSpace = The sensor passes over the terrain of Moho, surveying for variances in the gravitational field.
		MohoSrfLanded = Landing here has provided a very accurate and stable measure of gravitational forces.
		MohoSrfLanded = Moho’s gravity and density implies that a metal-rich core occupies at least 60% of the planet's mass, a figure twice as great as for Kerbin!
		MohoSrfLanded = The gravitational pull of this planet is high for one of its size. The core must be extremely dense.
