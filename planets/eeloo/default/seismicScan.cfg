		EelooSrfLanded = The planet seems as still and dead as a rock right now. A large, frozen, ice-covered rock.
		EelooSrfLanded = Eeloo is silent.
		EelooSrfLanded = Was that a small tremor, or did the planet just shiver?
		EelooSrfLanded = The scans indicate that the ice below you is moving slightly.
		EelooSrfLanded = Vibrations suggest that the surface of Eeloo is in fact moving over a liquid core.
		EelooSrfLanded = The ice and rock appear to be shifting slightly, indicating some internal heating.
		EelooSrfLanded = Darn it, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a geologist! How do I know if there's going to be an Eeloo quake?
		EelooSrfLanded = There's a slight quake every now and then, but not much noteworthy activity.
		EelooSrfLanded = There's not much seismic activity out here.
		EelooSrfLanded = Some seismic activity suggests that the interior of Eeloo is not completely frozen.
