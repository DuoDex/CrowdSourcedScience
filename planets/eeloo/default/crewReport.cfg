		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder about the ship that got you here. Are you really sure you can get back?
		EelooSrfLanded = As you trip and fall on a very small rock, you begin to lose feeling in your arms. Terrified of the sub zero temperatures, you look down and realize you've been laying on them.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel very cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel very hot. The physician diagnoses you with extreme hypothermia. Then you realize you hallucinated the physician.
		EelooInSpaceLow = You note that the capsule is not equipped with central heating, and Mission Control informs you this is because you were meant to go to Moho. This does not instill you with confidence.
		EelooInSpaceLow = For a moment, you can't quite remember which star is your sun.
		EelooInSpaceLow = I feel like we could go anywhere. Let's go. Like, now. Really, anywhere.
		EelooInSpaceLow = The crew look out towards the frozen ice ball Eeloo, and are momentarily lost for words. Few of Kerbal-kind have made it this far from home, and the courage, determination, and drive their species has to put them here dawns on everyone. Their thoughts are profound and humble, that so few are supported by so many.
		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo's sleek surface reminds you of home's ice caps. After some thinking about your distance from home, you go to sleep.
		EelooInSpaceLow = You're beginning to regret not bringing along the extra bag of snacks.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = The orbit of Eeloo being so odd, you begin to ponder the existence of a planet beyond it. You think a good name for this planet would be "Planet Y".
		EelooInSpaceHigh = You look out the window and notice beige stripes and spots on the surface. You immediately wonder if it's cookie dough.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = It reminds you of a snowball. Is it winter already?
		EelooInSpaceHigh = It looks like a great big spherical ice cube!
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Now this is an icy planet. You start imagining epic snowball fights in micro-gravity.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo looks very white; maybe someone covered it in a giant bed sheet?
		EelooInSpaceHigh = As you stare down at the splintered, lifeless surface, a question forms in your mind: "Was this really worth it?"
