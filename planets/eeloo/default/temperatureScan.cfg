		EelooSrfLanded = This far from the Sun, Eeloo's surface is barely affected by its radiation.
		EelooSrfLanded = Its cold, but you rub your hands together and think of home, and Moho.
		EelooSrfLanded = "COLD." Big surprise.
		EelooSrfLanded = After a long and thoughtful evaluation of the data using knowledge of thermodynamics and various fancy methods, you determine that Eeloo is, in fact, too cold to sensibly enjoy an ice cream cone on.
		EelooSrfLanded = Its a wee bit chilly.
		EelooSrfLanded = It's too cool for school.
		EelooSrfLanded = The ground temperature is higher than the surrounding space by a fraction of a degree.
		EelooSrfLanded = You watch the mercury in the thermometer break through the bottom and freeze.
		EelooSrfLanded = The display reads "really cold". You make a note to get a less sassy thermometer.
		EelooSrfLanded = The temperature is surprisingly hot. Perhaps there's some volcanic activity... nevermind, someone put the thermometer on upside down.
		EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer reads "Way too cold." You are beginning to question the qualifications of the science department.
		EelooSrfLanded = Temperatures have dropped bEeloo zero.
		EelooSrfLanded = What's colder than being cold? ICE COLD!
		EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer picks up trace amounts of temperature.
		EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer seems to be shivering. You give it a scarf and a mug of cocoa.
		EelooSrfLanded = The mercury seems to have retreated into the bulb at the bottom. You peck at the bulb several times, hoping for it to reemerge. Is it really that cold?
