		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for something neat.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Then, you throw a less cool looking rock into the sample container.
