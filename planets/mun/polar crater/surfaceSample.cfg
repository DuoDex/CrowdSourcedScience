		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = To your surprise, you find a large lump of ice lodged in the center of the crater. Upon further analysis you find that it doesn't taste particularly well, and is too chunky for the snow-cone machine.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = You examine the sample you've collected, and throw it into the container for further testing.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.
