		MunSrfLanded = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.
		MunSrfLanded = You begin to indicate concerns regarding whether or not the landing was simply an elaborate hoax, but the communications are interrupted by a strange voice telling you to keep quiet.
		MunSrfLanded = Boy, the lighting up here sure looks weird. Almost as if you were on a sound stage or something
		MunSrfLanded = Struck by a sudden urge to say something witty, you nearly choke on your snack.
		MunInSpaceLow = You glance by your window at the surfa... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
		MunInSpaceLow = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
		MunInSpaceLow = Looking down at the Mun's surface, you suddenly feel tempted to eat cheese.
		MunInSpaceLow = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = "Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it's much bigger than we thought it was."
		MunInSpaceLow = Wasn't there an opera written about this once?
		MunInSpaceLow = You don't know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be... interesting.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You are very proud of yourself for reaching this far!
		MunInSpaceHigh = You see a great sphere of mouldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the MÃ¼n.
		MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
		MunInSpaceHigh = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal's.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You look back at Kerbin. I looks rather small.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It seems that the Mun is one big giant rock with no atmosphere.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Those craters... what could they be caused by?
		MunInSpaceHigh = "Here I am floating in a tin can, far above the Mun."
