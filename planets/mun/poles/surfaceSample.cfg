		MunSrfLandedPoles = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realize that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
