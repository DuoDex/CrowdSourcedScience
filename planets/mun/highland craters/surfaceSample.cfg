		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = Seems muddy, in a waterless kind of way. You find it appropriate to remove your shoes before boarding the ship again, no thought given to the problems of removing space attire while still outside.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = This crater seems to filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
