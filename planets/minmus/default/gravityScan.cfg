		MinmusSrfLanded = The gravity readings dash your hopes - based on its size, Minmus is far too dense to be made of ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.
