		MinmusSrfLanded = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if it's possible to EVA to the surface and back.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Jet-packing down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if Minmus tastes of mint, and if you could make a fortune selling tiny edible planets.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You watch Minmus' surface shimmer beneath and wonder if your tongue would stick to the ground upon a thorough licking.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Here we are. The giant mint in space.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You look out of the window and suddenly feel homesick.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Let's go back, I saw a cool rock down there.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = You note that your radio fails to transmit when set to the OFF position.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Kerbin looks small. The Mun looks small. Even the Sun looks small. You turn the binoculars the right way round.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Please let it be a sea of lime sherbet.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Well, it's certainly much smaller in person.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = At this distance, Kerbin is little more than a pale blue dot, floating the the inky vastness of space.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Hm, how much debris could you kick up if you jumped into one of those lakes from here?
