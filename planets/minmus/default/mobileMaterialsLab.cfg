		MinmusSrfLanded = As you open the doors a sample dashes past to taste the surface.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Some of the biological samples have not fared well. The metals, however, appear to be doing just fine.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The low temperature has frozen one of the liquid samples into a sort of iced cream. Was it green before?
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The samples react to the lack of an atmosphere.
