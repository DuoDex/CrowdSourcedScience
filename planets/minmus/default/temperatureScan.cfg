		MinmusSrfLanded = The ground seems to reflect most of the Sun's thermal energy, yet the ground temperature is much higher than it should be. This warrants further investigation.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you suspected, it's very cold here.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You secretly wish the temperature were hot enough to cause you to sweat. You packed extra ice cream for the occasion.
