		IkeInSpace = The sensor verifies that Duna and Ike are tidally locked.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity scanner reports a low reading, very similar to that of the Mun. Do all moons have the same gravity? R&D notes the theory down, but they use a pencil just in case.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity is very low!
		IkeSrfLanded = You detect fluctuations in Duna's tidal effect as it liberates in the distance.
