		IkeSrfLanded = It seems like a hike would be nice. What might you see from the other side of this moon? Pack plenty of air!
		IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
		IkeSrfLanded = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
		IkeSrfLanded = You get a strange sense of deja-vu.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life could... "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
