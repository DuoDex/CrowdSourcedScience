		PolSrfLanded = The temperature varies from one rock formation to another. They must each conduct heat differently.
		PolSrfLanded = Scientists have confirmed that there is no temperature present on Pol.
		PolInSpaceLow = The thermometer wants to come inside because it's cold.
		PolInSpaceLow = The temperature varies as you fly over the terrain.
