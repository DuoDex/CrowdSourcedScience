		SunInSpaceLow = Everything is on fire.
		SunInSpaceLow = The materials are turning crispy and golden. You start to feel hungry again.
		SunInSpaceLow = The samples seem to have completely fried.
		SunInSpaceLow = Things are starting to melt in here.
		SunInSpaceLow = Some of the containers are so hot that their glass is melting.
		SunInSpaceLow = Some of the samples appear to be dissolving. The remaining samples appear to be dissipating. It is hard to distinguish the two effects from one another.
		SunInSpaceLow = The samples are cooking up nicely. Time to turn them over and add some salt.
		SunInSpaceLow = Some of the pieces facing the sun are now covered with little glowing cracks.
		SunInSpaceLow = Some of the material samples have started to glow from the intense radiation.
		SunInSpaceLow = The samples appear to be sweating.
		SunInSpaceLow = The red hot glow of the metallic samples rivals the blazing intensity of the sun.
		SunInSpaceLow = It says here "directly expose to sun for five minutes for a brilliant golden colour."
		SunInSpaceLow = The materials in the lab very clearly want to be farther away from the sun.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The rocks show little signs of change. Some phosphorous samples glow a bright blue color, indicating the high radiation of interplanetary space.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The materials, now exposed directly to the sun, are decidedly uncomfortable.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Something is starting to boil.
