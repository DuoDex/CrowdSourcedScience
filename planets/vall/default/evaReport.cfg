		VallSrfLanded = The ground beneath you suddenly lurches, and you hear the sound, carried up through your feet, of immense ice plates scraping against each other.
		VallSrfLanded = Well, the ice is... thick. You wonder if there's a frozen waterfall somewhere.
		VallSrfLanded = The surface shivers as the deeper crust buckles and fractures. You want badly to get back inside the ship now.
		VallSrfLanded = The rocks are of a bluish-green colour... Pretty!
		VallSrfLanded = The ground rumbles ominously beneath you before you realise that you're just hungry.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice crystals look very shiny.
		VallSrfLanded = You wish you'd brought your ice skates.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice melts down and evaporates from the friction of your space boots. You concentrate very hard on keeping your balance.
		VallInSpaceLow = Closer investigation of the planet makes you think of Minmus. You are once again hungry for mint dessert.
		VallInSpaceLow = You look at all the valleys and wonder what made them that way.
		VallInSpaceHigh = You see a sparkling stream of crystals blast into the sky in the distance.
