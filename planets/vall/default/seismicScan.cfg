		VallSrfLanded = The seismic scan indicates that there is a sudden density change a significant distance below the surface.
		VallSrfLanded = Wow, what a quake! Something big must have just shifted underground.
		VallSrfLanded = This data would be very valuable in advancing science if the screen hadn't iced over.
		VallSrfLanded = You detect some underground tremors. You decide they are caused by cryovolcanic events.
