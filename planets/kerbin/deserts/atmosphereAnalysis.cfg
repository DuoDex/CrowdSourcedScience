		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much dryer over the desert.
                KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = The sensor reads 0 humidity.  In fact it looks like the needle is bent as the guage tries to register negative numbers.
