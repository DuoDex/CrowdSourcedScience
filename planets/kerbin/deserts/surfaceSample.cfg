		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you're in a climate-controlled suit, because it sure looks hot out there.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Sand, sand, and more sand. A rock adds some badly needed variety to the landscape.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You saw a blue box on the horizon, but it was just an illusion. Also, you picked up a stone.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You remember your wilderness survival training… wait, do you need that training in space? What are you doing here in the desert? Someone is going to answer for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
