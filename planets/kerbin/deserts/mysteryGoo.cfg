		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo seems to hate it here.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo dehydrates quicky.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo appears to be drying up here. Maybe all this hot, dry weather has something to do with it.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo appears not to be wet. Likely due to lack of water.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo swishes around its container. You stop yourself from taking a sip despite the hot desert heat.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo is a jiggly pyramid.
