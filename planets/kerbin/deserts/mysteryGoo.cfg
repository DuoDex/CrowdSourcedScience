		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo seems to hate it here.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo dehydrates quickly.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo appears to be drying up here. Maybe all this hot, dry weather has something to do with it.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The Goo appears not to be wet. Likely due to lack of water.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo swishes around its container. You stop yourself from taking a sip despite the hot desert heat.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo is a jiggly pyramid.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The deserts look like they could use a drink, You wonder what would happen if you pour the Goo out the window,
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The goo is thrilled to feel the wind whipping through its hair. Its hair? But it's goo, it doesn't have hair. In any case, the goo seems ecstatic.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Mystery Goo-based precipitation, now there's a thought. Did you just solve Kerbin's desertification problem?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You contemplate the goo as the goo contemplates the kerbals on the surface contemplating you. Strange.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo takes this opportunity to shake the sand out of its fur. Wait...since when did the Goo have fur?!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The goo seems to be leaning out of the container to get a better view of the surface below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to be taking a perverse satisfaction at the lifelessness of outer space. You nervously try to stay out of its sight.
