                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Barometer reads very high. No rain in sight.  In fact you wonder if it has EVER rained here.
		KerbinFlyingLow = It's not going to rain for a long time.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You wonder what a desert storm would look like.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Readings here are the same as usual: high. Nothing else to report.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The display gives very little indication that you're flying over a desert.
