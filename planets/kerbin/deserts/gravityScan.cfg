                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You look around at some dried bones scattered on the ground, and feel the tug of Kerbins' gravitational field pulling you to the earth.  Or maybe that is just your imagination.  Time for some snacks! 
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = The dunes appear to have a stable gravity, though some spikes indicate the underground terrain varies in composition.
                KerbinInSpaceHighDeserts = The graviolis here seem dry and dusty like the surface below.  You consider offering them a glass of water, but have no idea how to speak gravioli.
