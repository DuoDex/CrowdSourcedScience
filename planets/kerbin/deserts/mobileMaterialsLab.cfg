		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.
                KerbinFlyingLow = The lab seems to be picking up some of the dry, dusty particles from the surface as you fly so close to the ground.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder if that half sandwich you left in the fridge at home is still there, as you write up yet another lab report.  When will the reports end and the sandwiches begin??
                KerbinInSpaceLow = LLLLAAAABBBB RRRREEEEPPPPOOOORRRRTTTT IIIINNNN SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE!!!! Ahem, yes, everything is nominal.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down at the surface through the lab window as you process results from your latest experiment.  Kerbin looks so small from up here.
