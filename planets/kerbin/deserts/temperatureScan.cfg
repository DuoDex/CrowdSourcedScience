		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's hot here. That's not a reading, you learned it in primary school.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Large plumes of heat are rising from the surface of the desert.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The temperature here is very hot.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The thermometer quickly rises beyond the scale limit. You put it back into the shadows before it bursts.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Even here above the surface it is hot.  The thermometer reads 270 degrees. You wonder if that is in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.  Oh well, the scientist back at KSC will figure it out.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Your temperature readings over the desert surprise exactly nobody back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The thermometer is hanging on to the capsule by only one corner, and you are afraid if you touch it it will go flying off.  We should have used the super-glue instead of the OK-glue.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You resist the urge to place your craft into a steep dive just to see how fast the thermometer changes.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The residual heat of the spacecraft masks the coldness of the empty vacuum of space.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Well, not much heat to measure here.
