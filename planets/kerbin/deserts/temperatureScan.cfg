		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's hot here. That's not a reading, you learned it in primary school.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Large plumes of heat are rising from the surface of the desert.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The temperature here is very hot.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The thermometer quickly rises beyond the scale limit. You put it back into the shadows before it bursts.
