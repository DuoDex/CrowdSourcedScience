                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around the stunted trees noting that you are FINALLY taller than something.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Dude, seriously.  You know what happens when we try to EVA here.  It never ends well.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Even with only a thin spacesuit separating you from the landscape below the plant life still looks tiny and stunted.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You marvel at how many plants can look so small as you consider letting go of the ship to float freely through space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You do a somersault and a backflip from the hatch onto the side of the ship.  How do you like THAT KSC?
