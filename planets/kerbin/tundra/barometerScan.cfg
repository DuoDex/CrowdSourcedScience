                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You don't think that this would be a nice place to live. the barometer concurs.
                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The barometer seems extremely high here.  You can almost feel the pressure squeezing the ship.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer seems to be questioning it's own existence.  Well, at least you agree on something.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer suggests the area has a prevalence towards blizzards. Might not be a good idea to stay here much longer.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this altitude, a barometer scan is almost purely a formality.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Pressure is nominal.  Nothing to see here folks.  Move along.
