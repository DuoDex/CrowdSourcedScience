                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The gravity here seems to be stunted, just like everything else in this bleak landscape.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = The graviolis seem sluggish and unresponsive.  You wonder if they need a snack as much as you do.
		KerbinInSpaceHighTundra = You wonder why the gravity field seems weaker here, and then remember that you are flying over the Tundra.  Everything is smaller in the Tundra.
