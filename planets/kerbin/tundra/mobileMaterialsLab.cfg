                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The lab seems small and cramped here.  You quiclk finish your report and get some fresh air.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The materials seem to have shrunk in their containers, which makes completing your research diffiult.  Hey, we're getting hazard pay for this, right?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = With all the experiments well underway you grab a box of snacks, wishing it was bigger than it is.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab has a certain 'vacuuminess' to it here.  You note that in the report to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The air in the lab seems stale and cramped even  though you are far above the planet.  You wonder why.
