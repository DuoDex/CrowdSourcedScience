                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The Goo seems to have shrunk into a pea size ball.  You consider eating it, but decide to just throw it outside the door instead.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo holds on to the container lid for dear life.  It appears as though you are caught in a life-or-death struggle.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo seems to be shrinking awa from the sight of the landscape below.  You don't know if this is normal, or if you should be feeding it more snacks.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be cavitating at 33.47652 mhz. Strange. You wonder what that means.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = After having yet another box of snacks you decide to check on the Goo and find it spilled all over the floor.  See, this is why we can't have nice things.
