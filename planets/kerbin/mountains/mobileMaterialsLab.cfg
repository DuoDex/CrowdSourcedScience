                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The lab slowly rocks back and forth as you perform your experiments perched on top of a particularly craggy mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You are so distracted by the thought of one of the craggy peaks below scraping up against the lab that you're unable to finish the assay.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Your lab report contains nothing out of the ordinary, but you write it up for the scientists back at KSC anyway.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You finish your labwork, write up the report, and pull out the snacks. Job well done!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You intermittently stare out the window at the mountains below as you write up your report.  Space is awesome!
