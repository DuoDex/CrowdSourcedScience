		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The lab slowly rocks back and forth as you perform your experiments perched on top of a particularly craggy mountain.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You're quite certain that lugging around an entire materials lab while on top of a mountain is as dangerous as it is unnecessary. But hey, you're just an astronaut.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hope the autopilot is up-to-snuff as you write your lab report while your craft zips past several mountain peaks.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You are so distracted by the thought of one of the craggy peaks below scraping up against the lab that you're unable to finish the assay.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You perform your experiments as you fly high over Kerbin's mountains. Oh look! Is that a yeti?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Your lab report contains nothing out of the ordinary, but you write it up for the scientists back at KSC anyway.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You finish your lab work, write up the report, and pull out the snacks. Job well done!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The mountains below have little to no bearing on the outcome of your experiments. Even so, you reference them in your report as much as possible, to impress the folks back home.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ah a quiet journey, a mouthful of snacks, and a beautiful view of Kerbin's mountain ranges! If it wasn't for the lab report you have to write, this would be the perfect moment. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You intermittently stare out the window at the mountains below as you write up your report.  Space is awesome!
