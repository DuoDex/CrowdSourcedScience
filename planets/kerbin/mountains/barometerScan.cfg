                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The barometer reads very high here.  You aren't surprised as the mountaintop nearly pierces the clouds.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer shakes and shimmies so much in the atmospere that you are unable to get an accurate reading.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = In the thin, wispy layers of the upper atmosphere a barometer reading is not particularly useful.  You take the reading anyway and send it back to KSC.
