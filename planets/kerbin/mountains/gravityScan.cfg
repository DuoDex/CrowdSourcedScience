		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = On solid ground you are able to detect the faint anomalies in the gravitational field caused by the mountain you are standing on.  The guys back at KSC will be excited!
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The gravitational field is rather strong in these mountain ranges.
                KerbinInSpaceHighMountains = The massive mountain range below registers on your graavitational scanner as you fly by.  Just another day in the life of an astronaut.
