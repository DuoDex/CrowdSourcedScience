                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You feel like the king of the world standing on this mountain.  Or at least the king of the mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay, just hallucinating.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The mountains rise up from the grasslands of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from up here.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You peer down at the mountains below, wondering if there is anyone down there looking up at you.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can barely make out the ridges of Kerbins mountains from this altitude, but enjoy a few snacks with the view.
