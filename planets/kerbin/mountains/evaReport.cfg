                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You slowly inch your way away from the spacecraft, just to tell KSC you did, hoping that you don't get blown off the mountaintop by the winds.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Uhhhh...It's cold, windy, and we're really close to a mountain.  Why are we doing this EVA again?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The craggy mountains below look even closer now that there is no spaceship between you and them.
		//KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = You feel like you are in a dream just floating above the mountains below.  Hey, you ARE floating above the mountains below!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The view of the mountains below is much clearer when you're not looking through the window of a spaceship.
