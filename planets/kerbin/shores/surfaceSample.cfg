		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You pick up a small creature with far too many legs. Mission control denies your request to keep it as a pet.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You scoop up some watery sand and decide the best use for it is to build a sand castle.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Hey look, a wristwatch! Finders, keepers!
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You build a sand castle, then take a sample of it. It's sand.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You pick up a particularly nice-looking seashell and add it to your personal collection. The not-so-nice ones you send to Mission Control.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.
