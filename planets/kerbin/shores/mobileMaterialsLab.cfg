                KerbinSrfLandedShores = Why are you in the lab when you could be at the beach?
		KerbinFlyingLow = The materials seem to have been contaminated by bits of sand and seaweed, but you perform your experiments anyway.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You sneak long glances out the window as you wait for the experiments to complete.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, didn't we used to have a microwave in this lab?  How are we supposed to get good results when we cant properly heat up our snacks?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The report seems to be the same as last time.  You wish you could be hanging out on the shores right now.
