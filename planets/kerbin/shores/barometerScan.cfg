                KerbinSrfLandedShores = Data from the barometer seems to indicate a storm within the next few hours. You wonder if you'll get to see a shipwreck. You hope it's not yours.
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = The barometric pressure here is high, but you are more interested in sneaking a glance at the bathing suits on the beach.
                KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer's dial moves left and right as you watch the surf batter the shores.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Readings seem nominal. Snack time!
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You send the barometer data back to KSC and reminisce about the good times you have had on these same beaches.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = High above the shore you scribble yet another note on the barometric pressure, thinking about all the Kerbals sunning themselves below.
