		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You wonder if there's a setting on the thermometer that allows it to warn you of sand-sharks.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to go for a swim.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The water here is warmer than in the open ocean, perhaps because there's less of it for the Sun to warm up.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to be a lucrative shark mating area.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Yep, the ambient temperature is the definition of "beach weather".
                KerbinFlyingLowShores = The thermometer reads a balmy 'medium-hot'.  Yep, another beautiful day at the shores.  Too bad you're stuck in this rocket.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature seems just about perfect here.  You consider doing an EVA without your spacesuit.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this altitude, the warmth of the beach is a thing of the past.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As usual the thermometer here is unreliable.  You write down its reading anyway for the scientists back at KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Thermometer reading? Check. Space is cold? Check. Time for a snack? Check!
