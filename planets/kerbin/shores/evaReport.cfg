                KerbinSrfLandedShores = You look at the inviting waves and realize that you forgot your swimsuit!
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Ew! Something just touched your foot. Oh wait, it's just seaweed.
                KerbinFlyingLowShores = You wave at all the Kerbals on the beach below.  Surely this will make the news reports.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Kinda cold and windy out here.  Not at all like being on the surface at the shores.  You wish you hadn't smeared sunscreen all over your EVA suit now.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You are mesmerised by the glint of the sunshine off the waves below as you stare through the thin visor of your helmet.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're in space! Take that Kraken!  Who's laughing now, huh???
