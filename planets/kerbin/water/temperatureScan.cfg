                KerbinSrfLandedWater = The salty water has encrusted the thermometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading.  So you make something up.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water is colder than the surrounding air.
                KerbinFlyingLowWater = The air seems to be cooled by the water, and the temeprature is lower that average here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It appears to be the perfect snack-eating temperature.  You open a box just to be sure.  For science.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature scan is inconclusive, but you bet it's chilly out there.  You tell KSC about your supposition.
