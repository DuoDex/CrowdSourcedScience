                KerbinSrfLandedWater = Surprisingly all the water didn't short out the instrument, and you are able to get a good reading to send back to KSC.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
                KerbinFlyingLow = Drops of saltwater seem to have encrusted the barometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading.  You make something up randomly, and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer here seems nominal.  What's not nominal is the anount of snacks we haven't eaten yet.  You radio KSC about this issue.
