		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The Goo dives underwater and comes back with a little jellyfish buddy.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The Goo seems to be soaking up the water like a sponge.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You douse the Goo in shark repellent and tell it to spread itself out around the craft.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The Goo escapes into the water!
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The Goo is freshly hydrated and starts to dissolve.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = In an effort to remain invisible, the Goo turns itself into a fish. A fish shape. A fishy shape. It looks like a fish.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A bird flies into the Goo, which disturbs it rather violently.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo wants to belly flop into the ocean below. You manage to close the canister just in time.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You pull the Goo out of its container and wring it out like a sponge.  It doesn't look happy with you.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo makes a fair imitation of the waves far below.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be leaking out of the container.  You knew we should have used titanium for those things.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As the Goo enjoys its new-found freedom as you pass over Kerbin's Water.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder what would happen if you mixed the Goo with Koolaid powder.  An experiment for another day.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you spot Kerbin's oceans from the viewport, you decide to tell the Goo an old joke about a one-armed pirate and his pet jellyfish.
