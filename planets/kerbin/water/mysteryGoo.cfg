		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The Goo seems to be soaking up the water like a sponge.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The Goo escapes into the water!
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The Goo is freshly hydrated and starts to dissolve.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = In an effort to remain invisible, the Goo turns itself into a fish. A fish shape. A fishy shape. It looks like a fish.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A bird flies into the Goo, which disturbs it rather violently.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You pull the Goo out of its container and wring it out like a sponge.  It doesn't look happy with you.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be leaking out of the container.  You knew we should have used titanium for those things.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder what would happen if you mixed the Goo with Koolaid powder.  An experiment for another day.
