		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You hope they made this spacesuit waterproof as well as space-proof.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You calculate the number of snacks you should bring to be able to swim to KSP.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You think you see a shark swimming in the water. Wait, no, that's just a landing leg.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Is that a shark over there?
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Something nibbles on your foot.
                KerbinFlyingLowWater = You are so close to the waves that you can almost touch them.  KSC recommends against this, though.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You consider taking your helmet off to smell the fresh ocean breeze, but the frantic yelling over the comms from KSC convinces you otherwise.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = You are reminded of the myriad sailors who have been adrift in the ocean below.  And here you are, the first one adrift in space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, look at that view.  Now if only we could figure out how to pack snacks in these suits.
