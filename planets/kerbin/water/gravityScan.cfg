                KerbinSrfLandedWater = The graviolis are soaking wet, but they report nominal gravity.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The sensor has detected changes in the local gravity that seem to be related to the passing of the Mun.
                KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The sensor shows a surprising variance as it passes over the oceans, hinting at what lies deep below the waters.
                KerbinInSpaceHighWater = The smooth stream of graviolis creates a strong reading.  You send the report back to KSC for their analysis.
