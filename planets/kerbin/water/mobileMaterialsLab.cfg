		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been enlightening.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.
                KerbinFlyingLow = The materials lab seems particularly damp.  You pull out a mop and bucket to be safe as you finish your report.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = All of the materials are still wet from the mishap-that-shall-not-be-named earlier.  You jot down some random numbers and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The view from the lab is particularly distracting today, and you find it takes an extra hour to complete your report.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab shimmers blue in the reflected light from Kerbins ocean below.  Or maybe you're just delerious from lack of snacks.
