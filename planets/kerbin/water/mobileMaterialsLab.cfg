		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been enlightening.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.
