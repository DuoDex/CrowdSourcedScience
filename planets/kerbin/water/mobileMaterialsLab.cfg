		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You submerge the materials bay into the water and it comes back up with a decent haul of codfish.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been enlightening.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You take care to limit your samples exposure to the humid sea air. Some of them are rather susceptible to corrosion.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The materials lab seems particularly damp.  You pull out a mop and bucket to be safe as you finish your report.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You are unable to properly finish your lab report. The sight of all the water below you keeps making you get up and go to the bathroom.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = All of the materials are still wet from the mishap-that-shall-not-be-named earlier.  You jot down some random numbers and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The view from the lab is particularly distracting today, and you find it takes an extra hour to complete your report.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Some of your samples create interesting refractions as they are exposed to the sunlight reflecting from the blue waters of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write down your lab report you visually confirm that Kerbin's oceans do indeed make up the majority of its surface.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab shimmers blue in the reflected light from Kerbins ocean below.  Or maybe you're just delerious from lack of snacks.
