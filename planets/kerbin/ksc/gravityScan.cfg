		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
                KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The grviolis try to look professional. It's not really working.
                KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The new recruits crowd around to check out your awesome sensor.
                KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = You measure the gravity slightly increasing as the crawler goes by.
                KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = Being on top of the pole you realize the gravity of the situation. 
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad =  The sensor gets burned to a crisp from the rocket exhaust, and is useless now. 
                KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The operators here think that the universe revolves around them, but your gravity readings indicate otherwise.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway =  You are too busy dodging taxi-ing planes to get an accurate reading. 
                KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The gravity here seems normal.  Snacktime!!
                KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the VAB.
                KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The graviolis seem too busy doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.  
                KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
                KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The gravity sensor defers to the barometer on this one. 
                KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The graviolis seem to be strangely attracted to the tracking station.  You are disappointed in them.
                KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = Graviolioliolioliolioliolioli.  Sorry, the scanner seems to have gotten stuck with the interference from the dish.
                KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement.
                KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement. 
                KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = The graviolis are drawn into the tracking station like a giant vacuum.  You always thought this place sucked.
                KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The graviolis stare in awe at the construction going on inside.
                KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the SPH.
- KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = 
                KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The graviolis are having too much fun doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.
                KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&D =  The graviolis feel very much at home here, surrounded by kerbals that care about them. 
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You feel like a rockstar with your gravioli detector here.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You don't really care about the gravioli experiment here.  You just like how cool it makes you look to take readings.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = You have to fight off hordes of R&D techs trying to disassemble your gravioli detector to see how it works.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = This is the perfect spot to observe graviolis, and your measurement indicates: nominal.  Now that was disappointing.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Confused as to which side this lab is on, the graviolis don't know whether to read positive or negative.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The graviolis feel cramped in here, and register a higher reading than normal.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
                KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel =  The instrument gets blown away and rolls down the tarmac before you can take an accurate reading. 
		KerbinInSpaceLowKSC = The graviolis appear happy to finally be escaping Kerbins gravitational well.
		KerbinInSpaceHighKSC = The graviolis look concerned that they may not be able to interact much at this altitude.
