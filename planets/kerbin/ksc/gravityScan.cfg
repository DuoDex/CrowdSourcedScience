		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The graviolis try to look professional. It's not really working.
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The new recruits crowd around to check out your awesome sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = You measure the gravity slightly increasing as the crawler goes by.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = Being on top of the pole you realize the gravity of the situation. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad =  The sensor gets burned to a crisp from the rocket exhaust, and is useless now. 
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The operators here think that the universe revolves around them, but your gravity readings indicate otherwise.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway =  You are too busy dodging taxiing planes to get an accurate reading. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The gravity here seems normal.  Snack time!!
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the VAB.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The graviolis seem too busy doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.  
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The gravity sensor defers to the barometer on this one. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The graviolis seem to be strangely attracted to the tracking station.  You are disappointed in them.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = Graviolioliolioliolioliolioli.  Sorry, the scanner seems to have gotten stuck with the interference from the dish.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = The graviolis are drawn into the tracking station like a giant vacuum.  You always thought this place sucked.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The graviolis stare in awe at the construction going on inside.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the SPH.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = You take in the gravity of the situation.  It is definitely more intense here.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The graviolis are having too much fun doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D =  The graviolis feel very much at home here, surrounded by kerbals that care about them. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You feel like a rockstar with your gravioli detector here.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You don't really care about the gravioli experiment here.  You just like how cool it makes you look to take readings.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = You have to fight off hordes of R&D techs trying to disassemble your gravioli detector to see how it works.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = This is the perfect spot to observe graviolis, and your measurement indicates: nominal.  Now that was disappointing.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Confused as to which side this lab is on, the graviolis don't know whether to read positive or negative.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The graviolis feel cramped in here, and register a higher reading than normal.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around.  We should try this experiment somewhere else.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel =  The instrument gets blown away and rolls down the tarmac before you can take an accurate reading. 
		KerbinInSpaceLowKSC = The graviolis appear happy to finally be escaping Kerbin's gravitational well.
		KerbinInSpaceHighKSC = The graviolis look concerned that they may not be able to interact much at this altitude.
