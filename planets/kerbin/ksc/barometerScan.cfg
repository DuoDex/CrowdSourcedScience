		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storms fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer reads low pressure. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You realize that the pressure drops the higher you climb the pole.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The pressure drops as Montimer grows older.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The barometer defers to the gravity sensor on this one.
