		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer reads low pressure. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The pressure drops as Montimer grows older.
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = Since you are just checking the 'lowly barometer' the new recruits don't recognize you and walk right past.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The reading is pretty low right now since the crawler is not actively driving over the instrument. NOT FOR LONG THOUGH!
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You realize that the pressure drops the higher you climb the pole. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time. 
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission control is glad to hear that the reading indicates favorable conditions for a launch. And for lunch too!
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storm fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight! 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Another beautiful day at the SPH, and the barometer confirms it.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You eye the menacing clouds on the horizon as the barometer plummets.  Maybe we should hold off on that launch after all.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The barometer defers to the gravity sensor on this one.  
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The staff at the tracking station are unimpressed with your lowly barometer since it can't predict space-storms. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast =  You place the barometer right in the center of the dish just to aggravate those annoying Kerbals at the tracking station. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = You take a reading at the focal point of the dish, hoping that somehow it will focus the atmospheric pressure.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The mercury from the barometer leaks all over the dish as you take your reading. Oh well, you never liked the guys at the tracking station anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = Well, here you are, at the center of all those annoying, weaselly little....oh yeah barometer: seems normal.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB =  You are surprised to find a normal reading here.  Probably about the only thing that IS normal here. 
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = I don't know about the atmosphere, but the people here are definitely under a lot of pressure.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial =  Looking at the pod you consider how much more -and less- pressure it endured than your barometer could ever hope to.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = As you attempt to record your observation, one of the research scientists comes over to explain that a millibar is not where those little umbrellas that come in drinks come from.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = The folks at R&D disassemble your barometer before you have a chance to take a reading.  What did you expect?
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You hope to get a reading before your instrument is disassembled for parts by the staff here, by hiding in this corner. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = You point at an imaginary flying purple elephant to distract the staff here from disassembling your instrument just long enough to get a reading.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = How fitting to take your barometric pressure observation here.  Must have been fate.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = OK, how many labs are there here??  You're tired of barometric pressures, and just want some snacks. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The smallness of the lab constrict the atmosphere, causing a higher reading.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = You get distracted listening to your voice echo in the tanks and forget to take a barometric reading.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel =  The barometer blows away before you are able to record the results.  Oh well, it was worth a try.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Despite the fact that you are flying low over the surface, the reading is no lower than usual.
	        KerbinFlyingHigh = Despite the fact that you are flying high over the surface, the reading is no higher than usual.
