		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You look up at the stars and begin to count. You realize you should take off before you fall asleep.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You regret wearing a red shirt to work today.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You're not sure this is the right place to be.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You are waiting impatiently.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Are we going to launch? If not, I want cookies."
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You pause for a moment to rethink your life.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Are we there yet?"
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You pick up your pencil, but get distracted by the thought of space.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = This place looks very familiar.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Ignition, check. Fuel gauge, check. Parachute, check. Microwave, check. Wait, microwave?"
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You mutter a personal version of Shepard's Prayer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You get impatient and try to find the launch button so you can go to space already.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The launchpad... very interesting terrain we have here.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder why you experienced over 3 gs when the rocket was moved to the pad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Just a heads’ up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Are we there yet?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = “Wait! Let me out, I changed my mind!”
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Check ignition and may Von Kerman’s love be with you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder what that nasty smell is. Either there is a serious propellant leak or Bob had burritos for lunch. Again.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You examine the blinking lights and stare intensely at the fuel gauges. Looks like we are ready to go.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control reminds you that getting out and pushing is often a viable tactic.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you’re in space.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You think that you should be flying the craft instead of making boring logs.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a piece of paper from your notepad and draw a spaceplane on it.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Despite its name, the runway does not actually run.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The runway seems to run a long way.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = There's a nice view of mission control from here. You can see them waving back.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a sip of a soft drink before igniting the engines. Or was that after?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Don’t buzz the tower. The guy paying your salary is standing there and he doesn’t want his coffee spilled.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = “Clear Right. Clear Left. We’re good here. Ground control come in. Over.”
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Reporting from the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of traffic, because I don't think we ever got the clearance to be here.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = This runway needs a ramp.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You look out the window and can no longer remember if you've already returned from a mission or are yet to depart.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You think you should get inside the VAB and discuss if the rocket is good enough.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = As you sit in the capsule, you can't help but wonder why you haven't taken off yet.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This is our Space Center. We're home.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Deja Vu!
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You should probably climb the VAB!
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You wonder if this will be the site of your grave marker.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = You watch Montimer swing a golf ball into the pond.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = You Pretend to be the Crawler driver. After a Few minutes you realize that you'd rater fly to space.
