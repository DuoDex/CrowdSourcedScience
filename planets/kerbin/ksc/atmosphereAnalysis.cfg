		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you'd expect from a thriving space program.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Apparently, the atmosphere is made of ash and rocket fuel. But that might be because you're on the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = I think a fly just got in the research equipment... don't tell the scientists!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The extremely expensive array of sensors, samplers, and detectors has confirmed that today is a very good day to go to space. Which is nice, considering we already have the rocket out and everything.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The sensor detects an explosive atmosphere. Try getting off the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You install the sensor on top of the flag pole.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The sensor tells you thet the flag is working as advertised.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The atmosphere heats up as Montimer learns about how our funds have been spend lately.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = It's surprisingly windy out in the open.
