		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The goo lunges towards the nearest dumpster, perhaps the one that the goo can came from in the first place.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo has given up and is heading home.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The goo seems to be giving you a funny look.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo seems bored.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo looks as if it is a puddle of water.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo needs to go back to the lab. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The Goo wants to go the other way. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = You convince the new recruits that tasting the Goo is a rite of passage.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Goo stands it's ground. 
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The Goo looks up the pole in Awe. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now. Maybe you should poke it with a stick.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo seems very excited for what's about to happen.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo is now a little nervous.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo wants to go somewhere
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo appears to be wondering what the next few minutes are going to entail.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo appears to have braced itself for high g-forces.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Don't worry, The Goo won't do anything right now. It'll just sit there.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The Goo seems enamoured with all the flashing lights on the control panels.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The Goo seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The Goo has a black tone as light reflects off the runway into the canister. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The engineers at the SPH spread some of the Goo on the control surfaces, in hopes of actually making their plane fly.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The Goo is nonplussed.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The Goo contemplates how much of the tank it could fill.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The Goo splits itself into pieces and hides in the tanks.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The Goo does indeed seem a bit watered down here.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The Goo seems indifferent to this place despite you muttering under your breath.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = The Goo sticks to the dish as you spread it over the surface.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = You toss the entire container of Goo at the dish, and it passes completely through, leaving a gaping hole.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The Goo seems to have worked it's way into the wiring of the dish and shorted it out.  No big loss.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You threaten to "unleash" the Goo on the first staffmember here who looks at you sideways.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The Goo shakes with excitement.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = As you open the container the Goo gets covered in old bits of rocket parts and pieces of blueprints.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The Goo seems somber.  Or maybe inspired.  It's hard to tell.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The Goo comments that it's container is far more round than the tank.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The Goo seems oddly defensive around the tanks here.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The Goo looks forward to researching the researchers.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding =  The Goo looks around inquisitively at all the eyes peering down at it. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = The Goo gets down to business doing it's own research.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = The Goo contemplates the meaning of Kerbalhood.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = The Goo observes you observing it.  Eerie.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The good sloshes to the side of its container in honor of the research that has been performed here in the past.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The Goo looks cramped here, like it needs to stretch its...uhhhh...self. Yeah, that's it: stretch itself. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = The Goo promptly begins determining its compatibility with the substance in the tanks.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The Goo is promptly splattered against the wall as you open the container.  What did you expect, it's a wind tunnel!
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo hangs on for dear life.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo airs itself out in the cool breeze of the upper atmosphere.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be swirling in a most peculiar way.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo reflects on the fact that it is sitting in a tin can high above the world.
