		//KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your science report text here.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The ground here conducts vibrations about as effectively as concrete. You report your findings to the tower, but they don't seem very impressed.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You calibrate the detector one more time before lifting off.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The ground trembles with the ghosts of failed launches past.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder if repeated rocket launches have caused the ground to become unstable.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments. Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The needle jumps and shakes violently; moments later, you hear a distant explosion. Looks like somebody let Bill into the cafeteria kitchen again.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The lack of geologic activity - explosions not counting - reminds you why they built the space center here.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates heavy surface-borne activity nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates high levels of seismic activity coming from... the research lab.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The needle moves as you drop down the pole.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The needle moves. Montimer probably exploded again over the spending of funds.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = You wonder if dumping all the water will make the needle move.
