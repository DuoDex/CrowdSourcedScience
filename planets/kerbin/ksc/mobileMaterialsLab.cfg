		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials all seem to be posing, preparing for the scientists' examination.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The samples look like pretty much everything else around here.         
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The materials shine. You assume they want to look good when facing their bosses. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The new recruits are fascinated to see what a materials lab looks like.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Materials Bay rolls off and gets stuck between the tracks. 
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The materials seem unimpressed by your climbing skills. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You think that this experiment is rather superfluous.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The materials are neatly arranged, waiting for launch. You suppress the urge to shake the container. 
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl =  Mission control wonders why you have to do your experiment HERE. 
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The materials are all facing upwards. You hastily turn them sideways. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The great view of the new planes distracts you from getting any meaningful lab work done.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The engineers here eye your lab module with disdain.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You consider how much the lab looks like a tank.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = A leak from the tower washes away your materials before you can experiment on them.  Oh well, snack time!
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = You take the leftover materials and throw them at the tracking station, hoping they stick to the side of the building.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You play loud rock music in the lab, saying you are testing materials, but really you're just trying to annoy the folks at the tracking station.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth =  You position the lab directly in front of the dish to see what effect it will have on the materials. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The materials leak out and start corroding the tracking dish. You hope no-one else saw that.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You make a show of performing your experiment here, so the tracking station staff can see what a small contribution they make to the program.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = A welding rod fell into your experiment mid-way.  You don't know if this will effect the results, so you finish your report anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = The general commotion around here vibrates the materials off the lab bench.  You figure this qualifies as a result, and leave to have some snacks. 
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = You consider how similar the materials you are using are to the pod outside.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = You consider how much the lab looks like a tank.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = You are humbled to perform your experiments here, at their birthplace.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You feel right at home here in the lab.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = The materials fail to indicate which corner you are in.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = The staff here spend so much time in the lab themselves that they are completely uninterested in your results.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = You observe the materials while the R&D staff observe you.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The materials fail to indicate which side you are at. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = You are amused at the puny size of this lab compared to yours.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = Materials were "Ejected due to extreme baro-differential".  Luckily you managed to hang on.				
		KerbinFlyingLow = Materials are strewn across the lab as the ship performs a mostly-expected gravity turn.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You prepare the lab for both reentry and deep space travel, since you don't remember which direction you're headed.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The materials seem to float through empty...space.  That's it! We must be in space!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You think you glimpse KSC out the window as you finish up your lab report.
