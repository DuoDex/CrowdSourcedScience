		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You think that this experiment is rather superfluous.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The materials are neatly arranged, waiting for launch. You suppress the urge to shake the container.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The materials are all facing upwards. You hastily turn them sideways.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The samples look like pretty much everything else around here.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials all seem to be posing, preparing for the scientists' examination.
