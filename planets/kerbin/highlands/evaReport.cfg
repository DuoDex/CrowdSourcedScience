                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You catch yourself as you nearly step into a 100 meter crevasse and slide down a massive glacier. No wonder they call this the Highlands.
                KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You are afraid that your helmet will hit the peak of one of the mountains as you fly by.  Who thought an EVA was a good idea here, anyway.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You hold on for dear life as you hurtle through the atmosphere above some of Kerbins highest mountains.  Too much adrenaline.
                KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Yup, that's a mountain doown there.  What's of greater concern is the mountain of snacks that need to be eaten *nom, nom, nom*.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the frosty peaks of the planet below, and contemplate the meaning of life.  And the integrity of your spacesuit.
