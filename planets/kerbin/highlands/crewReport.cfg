                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = KSC, we have landed. I think. The altimeter still shows way too high for us to be on the ground, but our velocity is zero. So there you have it. Maybe.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = There can be only one report from the Highlands!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* "Colorado Rocky Mountain high. I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky". Ah, good 'ol John Denver.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Yep, we're in space alright, but you bet that if we left the landing gear down it would hit that mountaintop.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = You become homesick thinking about the mountains of Kerbin being the closest part of the planet to you at this altitude. Then you have some snacks, and it's all better.
