                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The graviolis seem very weak here.  Maybe it has something to to with the high altitude.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The instrument surveys the highlands of Kerbin. The rolling hills seem to affect local gravity slightly.
                KerbinInSpaceHighHighlands = Even at this distance, the gravity scan picks up the distinct signature of the massive mountains below.
