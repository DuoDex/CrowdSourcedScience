                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You make adjustments to the barometer to get an accurate reading at such a high altitude.  Hopefully they appreciate your work back at KSC.
                KerbinFlyingLow = *singing* "Under pressure. Ba da dum, ba da da dum, Ba da da dum, ba da da dum. Under pressure".
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer is covered in ice crystals at this altitude, and you are unable to get a good reading.  Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
