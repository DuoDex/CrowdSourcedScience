		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There's a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
                KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Even at this low altitude the atmosphere seems thin here.  Thoughts of a space-sherpa come to mind.
                KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = The atmosphere here seems squeezed between the high altitude of the mountains below, and the invisible barrier of space above. You are somewhere between a rock and no-place.
