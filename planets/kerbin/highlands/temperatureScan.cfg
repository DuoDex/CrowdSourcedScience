                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The thermometer tube seems to have exploded in the thin atmosphere here. We really shouldn't have bought the cheapest thermometer available.  Oh well, no temperature reading today.
                KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The snow and ice of the mountains has gotten stuck to the display of the thermometer.  As  you wipe it off and take a reading you are reminded of the snacks in your fridge back at home.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature here is higher than you expected, what with all the ice and snow.  Maybe THAT's why they call it the Highlands.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = As you look down over the majestic mountains below you take yet another temperature reading.  Stupid science.  At least the view is nice.
