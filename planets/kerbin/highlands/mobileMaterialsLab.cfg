                // situational science that is available for this body. You may

                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Most of the materials in the lab have either boiled off or frozen at this altitude.  You decide that it's not worth the effort to do research, and decide to have some snacks instead.
                KerbinFlyingLow = You find it difficult to concentrate on your lab research flying this close to the peaks below.  You write down some random gibberish to send back to KSC.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Almost above the mountains and into space.  When we get there we should have some snacks.  You know, as a reward for awesomeness.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You pull out your trusty lab notebook to make a note of what you observe. After 2 minutes of searching for a pencil you remember you are in space now, and find it floating in a corner.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you finish your lab experiments one of the massive peaks below catches your eye. It's amazing how small things look from way up here.
