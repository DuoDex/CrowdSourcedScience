                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The graviolis are all huddled  together, and you can't get an accurate reading.  Even THEY are freezing their butts off out here!
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
                KerbinInSpaceHighIceCaps = The spike in graviolis here indicates a large mass below.  Maybe it's the Ice Caps?
