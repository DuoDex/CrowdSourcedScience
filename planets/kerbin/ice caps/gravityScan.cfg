                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The graviolis are all huddled  together, and you can't get an accurate reading.  Even THEY are freezing their butts off out here!
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The scanner gives some interesting readings of the sub-surface. What secrets lie beneath the polar ice caps?
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = You complete your gravity scan over the Ice Caps. You eat a snack to celebrate. Then you eat another one because you like snacks.
                KerbinInSpaceHighIceCaps = The spike in graviolis here indicates a large mass below.  Maybe it's the Ice Caps?
                KerbinInSpaceHighIceCaps = The Ice Caps' gravitational signature is surprisingly distinctive considering your distance.
