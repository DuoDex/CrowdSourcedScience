		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You make some notes about different shades of white. You conclude that the spectrum ranges from white to extremely white.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You eagerly place a magnet on the ground. Nothing observable happens and you walk away disappointed.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You remembered an old tale of explorers who froze to death here and hope you don't end up the same way.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You know there is a joke some where in here about an ice hole, but you can't think of it.  Must be snack time!
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = If you fall, would you break through the ice? Probably best not to try.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Why? Just why? Of all the places to do an EVA why did we have to choose here?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Nothing but ice as far as the eye can see...you really want to go back in now.
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = The ice crystals spider across the visor of your spacesuit. You hope that the suit was made with more care than the parts that went into your rocket.
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Your try to touch an aurora but it remains fiendishly out of reach.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float above the bleak terrain in your EVA suit your mind wanders, as it often does, to snacks. Yummy, yummy snacks!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder why so much ice is built up around each pole...then again, you can't really think of a better place for them.
