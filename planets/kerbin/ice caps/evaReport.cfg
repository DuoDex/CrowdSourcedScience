		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You make some notes about different shades of white. You conclude that the spectrum ranges from white to extremely white.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You remembered an old tale of explorers who froze to death here and hope you don't end up the same way.
                KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You know there is a joke some where in here about an ice hole, but you can't think of it.  Must be snack time!
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Why? Just why? Of all the places to do an EVA why did we have to choose here?
                KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = The ice crystals spider across the visor of your spacesuit. You hope that the suit was made with more care than the parts that went into your rocket.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float above the bleak terrain in your EVA suit your mind wanders, as it often does, to snacks. Yummy, yummy snacks!
