		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The materials in the lab are viscous and difficult to work with. After struggling for a while you write up the data that you can, ready for the folks back at KSC.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The light reflects off the surface of the planet below as you stare out the window. Oh yeah....science. You finish writing up your report for the kerbals back at KSC.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab has a certain serenity flying so high above the planet. There is no place you'd rather be right now.
