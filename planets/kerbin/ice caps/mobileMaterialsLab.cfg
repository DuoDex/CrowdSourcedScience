		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
