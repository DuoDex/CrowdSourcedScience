		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid, so why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature reads -10, but in reality it is probably lower because that is as low as the thermometer can read.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Snacks fall out of your mouth and garble your speech as you try to read off the temperature.  KSC just regards it as a bad radio transmission, and waits for your next report.
