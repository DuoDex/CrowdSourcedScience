		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid, so why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Welp. That explains all the ice.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = As you read off the temperature to Mission Control, you are envious of how warm they all sound over the radio.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature reads -10, but in reality it is probably lower because that is as low as the thermometer can read.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature outside is well into the negatives. You are silently thankful for you climate-controlled spacesuit.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Snacks fall out of your mouth and garble your speech as you try to read off the temperature.  KSC just regards it as a bad radio transmission, and waits for your next report.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature is even lower than it would be if you were down in the Ice Caps. At least there's no wind chill.
