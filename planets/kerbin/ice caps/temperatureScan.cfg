		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid, so why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
