                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You wish you’d brought your ice skates.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long, your eyes start to water.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = “Hey look, it’s Santa ‘Claus’ Kerman!”
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The snowy ice caps look so fluffy and soft to land on.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You look down and are blinded by the white snow.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Over the ice and through the atmosphere, to KSC we go!  You wonder if grandmothers house is on the way.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You contemplate the vast swaths of ice below, wondering if any Kerbals have ever been there.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = KSC, I hope you know where I am, cause I just spilled coffee on the roadmap.
