		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The Goo starts to freeze. It doesn't seem to like it.
                KerbinFlyingLow = Bits of ice and snow become lodged in the Goo as you open the container. The Goo doesn't seem too happy about that.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo shivers as you open the container. You could swear you hear it say "Hey! Shut the door!"
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo is holding on to the inside of the container, and you're unable to open it.  You record the Goo as being "uncooperative".
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems happy, but mildly reticent of your current location.
