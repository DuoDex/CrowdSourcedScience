                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = A blade of grass gets caught in the outer casing of the sensor, and obstructs your view of the display.  Oh well, we'll just make something up.  They'll never know anyway.
                KerbinFlyingLow = Barometric pressure: 300 millibars.  Or is that 3000?  Whatever....look at the view down there.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it snack time yet? It has to be snack time.  No pressure readings till after snack time.
