		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The materials lab has grass-stains on it now from that landing.  So much for returning it to the manufacturer for a refund when we are done.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You crack open window as you write up the lab report and bask in the warm sunlight and soothing breeze.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A blade of grass flies into the lab and lands right in your experiment, ruining the results.  Oh well, we'll just make something up for the folks back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A butterfly flies into your experiment. You spend a distracting amount of time thinking up various non-lethal methods to get rid of it.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere buffets the side of the lab, distracting you as you write your lab report.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = A particularly persistent bird is following you around, perhaps attracted by the smell emanating from your exposed samples.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You play music as you write your lab report. It reminds you of your home amidst Kerbin's grassy plains.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab seems peaceful as you go about your study over the grassy plains below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You brought along some dirt from Kerbin's Grasslands for this experiment. You're not really sure what to do with it though.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Far below there is a biome of some sort.  You are too far away from the planet to tell which one, though.  We need better facilities in this lab.
