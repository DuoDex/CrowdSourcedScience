                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The materials lab has grass-stains on it now from that landing.  So much for returning it to the manufacturer for a refund when we are done.
                KerbinFlyingLow = A blade of grass flies into the lab and lands right in your experiment, ruining the results.  Oh well, we'll just make something up for the folks back at KSC.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere buffets the side of the lab, distracting you as you write your lab report.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab seems peaceful as you go about your study over the grassy plains below.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = Far below there is a biome of some sort.  You are too far away from the planet to tell which one, though.  We need better facilities in this lab.
