                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The graviolis seem strangely attracted to the grass.  There aren't more of them, but they seem more content here.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The grass doesn't seem to be too bothered by gravity. Look at them. swaying in the wind and such.
                KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = You happily much on a snack while performing a gravity scan over the Grasslands.
                KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = A scientist at KSC once told you that without gravity, the grass would grow into outer space! On second thought, he probably wasn't a real scientist.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The instrument surveys the gravity over the grasslands. It appears the field is very stable here.
		KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = Gravity scans over the Grasslands are normal...too normal. You begin to suspect that the gras is hiding something.
                KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = As you fly high over the grasslands you can feel the graviolis swarming around you. They seem excited.
