                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The graviolis seem strangely attracted to the grass.  There aren't more of them, but they seem more content here.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The instrument surveys the gravity over the grasslands. It appears the field is very stable here.
                KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = As you fly high over the grasslands you can feel the graviolis swarming around you. They seem excited.
