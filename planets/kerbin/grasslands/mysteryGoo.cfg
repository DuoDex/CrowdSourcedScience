		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The Goo takes on the shape of a leaf.
                KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems disappointed in your flying skills.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You regard the Goo uneasily as it seems to be stretching out in the container as if it is reaching for space. Or maybe it's just imitating a blade of grass.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to have happily curled into a ball, utterly uninterested in the grassy land below.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = You poke the goo, and some of it gets stuck to your finger. You quickly rub it off on your spacesuit, glad that you don't have to clean up at the end of this mission.
