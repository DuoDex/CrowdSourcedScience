		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The Goo takes on the shape of a leaf.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The Goo turns green with envy.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The Goo greedily gobbles up dirt and plant matter. You make a mentak note not to touch it.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A particularly stupid bird slams into your craft and is quickly absorbed by the Goo.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems disappointed in your flying skills.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo tries to fly away but since it lacks wings or thrusters, it fails.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You regard the Goo uneasily as it seems to be stretching out in the container as if it is reaching for space. Or maybe it's just imitating a blade of grass.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to have happily curled into a ball, utterly uninterested in the grassy land below.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo suddenly forms itself into a scale replica of Kerbin, accurately reflecting the visible biomes below. You didn't know it could do that.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You poke the goo, and some of it gets stuck to your finger. You quickly rub it off on your spacesuit, glad that you don't have to clean up at the end of this mission.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo waves goodbye to the planet of its birth. Not to be outdone, you do the same, only with both hands.
