		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you go trudging through the grass you hope you don't step on a cow-patty.  The spaceship will stink for the rest of the trip.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You free your potted plant and hope it does well in the wild.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Mission Control assures you, "don't panic."
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = "Why did I go outside? I really want to get back into the capsule!"
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The wind blowing through the vast hills and valleys of grass reminds you of waves on the surface of the ocean.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You imagine yourself as an intrepid explorer, daring to push back the boundaries of the unknown...then you see look out the window and see your mother. (Sigh) Hi mom.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The hills and valleys of the grasslands seem even closer looking through a spacesuit visor.  You begin to long for home. And snacks. Need more snacks.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = If you squint really hard you can see some of the scattered debris from your discarded booster stages.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of Kerbin stretches out before you.  You wonder what is happening far away on the rolling hills below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you conduct your EVA you use the Grasslands of Kerbin as a visual reference point to keep from getting confused.
