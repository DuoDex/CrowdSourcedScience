                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you go trudging through the grass you hope you don't step on a cow-patty.  The spaceship will stink for the rest of the trip.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Mission Control assures you, "don't panic."
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = "Why did I go outside? I really want to get back into the capsule!"
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The wind blowing through the vast hills and valleys of grass reminds you of waves on the surface of the ocean.
                KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The hills and valleys of the grasslands seem even closer looking through a spacesuit visor.  You begin to long for home. And snacks. Need more snacks.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of Kerbin stretches out before you.  You wonder what is happening far away on the rolling hills below.
