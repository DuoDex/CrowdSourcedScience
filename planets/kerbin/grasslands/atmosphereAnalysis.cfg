		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There's lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You decide to do one better and smell the air yourself. Ah, smells like home.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The atmosphere seems calm and peaceful here. Readings are nominal.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Ah so this is what a life-supporting atmosphere is supposed to look like.
		KerbinFlyingHighGrasslands = As you read the atmosperic analysis report you glance down at the surface below. The gentle undulating motion of the breeze through the grass makes you feel sleepy.
		KerbinFlyingHighGrasslands = You let the atmospheric sensor do its thing. You don't anticipate any earth-shaking discoveries.
