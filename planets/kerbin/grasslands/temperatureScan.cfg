		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The temperature here is quite pleasant. This would be a nice place to live.
                KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The temperature seems cool and comfortable.  It is probably due to the acres of green grass that stretch to the horizon.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = 82. Or is that 28? They never did tell you which side of this thing is up.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = And the temperature is: perfect for snacking! So how about a few snacks, and then we'll send this report off to KSC.
