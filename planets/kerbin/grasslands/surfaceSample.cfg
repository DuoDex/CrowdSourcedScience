		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You wonder why you put on a two-million-dollar space suit and got into a multi-billion dollar rocket just to pick up some dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Looks like dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Beautiful green grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Still dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = This is some quality grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I didn't sign up for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = An incredibly long, furry, purple creature slithers bizarrely out of the grass. You rub your eyes and when you look again there is nothing in sight.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I got a jar o' dirt! I got a jar o' dirt!
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You pick at the dirt and discover a worm under the grass. You promptly name him Kelbin and attempt to hug him but end up squishing him in your arms. You feel bad so you open up a container and gently place him inside.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You notice that someone may have planted onions here once.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Years of training has brought kerbalkind here, to find this handful of soil! You hope you won't be fired for that.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The substance contains a remarkable amount of organic material. Excited, you inform Mission Control of this fact, but they seem less than thrilled.
