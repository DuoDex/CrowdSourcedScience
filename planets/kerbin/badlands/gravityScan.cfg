                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The gravity here is just...gravity.  The scientists said it would somehow be 'bad' gravity.  Wish we were paid like them for being wrong, rather than exploding in a giant crashing fireball.
                KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = *singing* 'Get low, get low, get low, get low'. Oh yeah, gravity. Yeah, we got that.
		KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = The sensor gives a very negative readout as you pass over the badlands.
