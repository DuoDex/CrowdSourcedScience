		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito divebombing it. Apparently it's carrying malaria.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = It's not so bad here. You wonder what all the fuss was about.
                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The Gooey puddle you just stepped in appears to be eating through the material of your spacesuit. Better get back to the ship before the atmosphere outside is the same as inside your spacesuit.
                KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = The sensor records a sufurous rotten egg smell in the atmosphere.  So this is why they call it the Badlands.
                KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Ozone, check. Carbon Monoxide, check. Hydrofluorocarbons, check.  Yep, we're in the Badlands.
