                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = As the goo churns in its container you are reminded of a horror movie where an amorphous goo devours everything in its path.  Hope this experiment ends better than the movie.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hear a faint, distorted guitar riff coming from The Goo.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* 'Bad, Bad, Leroy Brown. Badder than the...'. Oh yeah, science. The mystery goo remains dark and mysterious.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The goo looks particularly dark and brooding here.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = Mystery goo and Badlands seem like a bad combination to you. Rather than opening a pandoras box, you forego the experiment and make up some data to send back to KSC.
