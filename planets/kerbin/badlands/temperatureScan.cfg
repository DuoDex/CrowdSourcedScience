		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature here appears to fluctuate depending on the time of day.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature is bad, and it's getting worse every minute.
                KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = It is HOT! You don't know whether it's the normal ambient temperature here, or whether the spacecraft is burning up.  Either way, we should have installed air conditioning.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Let's see...temperature. Slightly cooler than the firey pits of hell. Yep, that covers it.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Seriously? You want to know the temperature now? We're in space; who cares!
