		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The Sensor looks like it went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You transmit the readings. Mission Control immediately calls you back and demands to know if you are still on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You think that the barometer is broken but you're too scared to go outside and fix it.
		KerbinFlyingLow = One Hundred Million Pascals. That can't be right.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You remember that barometers are often used to forecast the weather. You examing the readings and decide that it might not be a good idea to be here in the next few hours.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The dial keeps spinning round and round. After consulting with Mission Control, you scribble a zero at the end of each of the measurements. The dial immediately points to the largest one.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It reads -3. Huh, that's funny. Oh well, they can figure it out back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Glancing at the display, you shake your head and feel sorry for anyone who lives down there.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You don't bother to look at the display. The fact that you're in the Badlands tells you all you need to know.
