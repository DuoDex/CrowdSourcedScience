		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You start to feel very nervous about all the bad things you said about the Badlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You start to share scary stories about the strange things found in the Badlands, but Mission Control shushes you.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You bet this is where all the cool kids come to land.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You have a bad feeling about this.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Crashing here would not be good.

                KerbinInSpaceLow = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.
