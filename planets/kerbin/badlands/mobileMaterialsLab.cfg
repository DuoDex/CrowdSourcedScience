		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry what it will do to them.
                KerbinFlyingLow = The lab is in complete disarray after hitting turbulence over the Badlands.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You are flying high over the Badlands, so naturally your thoughts turn to recreational substances.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You quickly slam the door shut on the lab after peeking in.  It doesn't look good in there, to say the least.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = You consider how nice it is to be in the lab rather than in the Badlands below you.
