		TyloSrfLanded = Is it me, or did my spacesuit just get really heavy?
		TyloSrfLanded = You try jumping... It isn't very effective
		TyloSrfLanded = You look around, trying to decide if the nerve-wracking descent was worth it. How are you going to get back?
		TyloSrfLanded = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = If surface composition is of any indication, there is a distinct possibility of finding underground lakes and caverns somewhere around.
		TyloSrfLanded = They say the gravity of Tylo adds five pounds.
		TyloInSpaceLow = You swear you just found Tylo's missing atmosphere! It's just too bad it floated away before you could grab it.
