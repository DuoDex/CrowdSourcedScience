		TyloSrfLanded = You quickly scoop up some white dust. You ran out of condiments three months ago.
		TyloSrfLanded = The rock sample is similar to what could be found on the Mun. There seems to be less evidence of volcanic activity, however.
		TyloSrfLanded = The ground gives way easily but the surface underneath is much harder.
		TyloSrfLanded = You hum a little tune to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface seems to be composed of rocks and ice. You quickly run density-mass calculations in your head, wondering how a moon has so much gravity.
		TyloSrfLanded = Some rock samples exhibit high heavy metal content.
