		EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
		EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
		EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is very high even at this altitude.
		EveSrfLanded = The pressure is cursing down here! You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.
		EveSrfLanded = Atmosphere? Yes!
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing."
		EveSrfLanded = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.
		EveSrfLanded = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any kerbals there.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.
		EveSrfLanded = It's buried the needle!
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.
		EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is very dense at the surface. It crushes down on the instrumentation.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.
		EveSrfLanded = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.
		EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.
		EveSrfSplashed = The pressure is very high. You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this purple sea.
		EveSrfSplashed = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.
