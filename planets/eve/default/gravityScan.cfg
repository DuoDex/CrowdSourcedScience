		EveInSpace = The sensor records slight variances in gravity as you pass over a massive crater site.
		EveInSpaceLow = The sensor spikes every time you orbit over an ocean.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravity here makes you feel really fat, while at the same time, you look quite skinny.
		EveSrfLanded = Just looking at the readout makes you feel heavier.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravity of Eve strongly supports your personal "Planet Core is a Black Hole" theory.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravitational field is very strong here. The sensor records detailed data about the local field.
		EveSrfLanded = So heavy... its weight level must be over 9000!
		EveSrfLanded = The sensor’s overload warning is on. It appears Eve’s gravity is almost too much.
		EveFlyingLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.
