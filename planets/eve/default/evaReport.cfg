		EveSrfLanded = You decide to take a short walk, but think better of it after the first few steps.
		EveSrfLanded = You feel like you may have put on some weight.
		EveSrfLanded = The purple behemoth dares you to slip.
		EveSrfLanded = You should have done more exercise back on Kerbin.
		EveSrfLanded = You wonder what jerk put lead weights in your suit.
		EveSrfLanded = The thick atmosphere makes it difficult to move around. You swear that if not for the high gravity, you could hover a bit just by flapping your arms.
		EveSrfLanded = The extreme pressure is making it hard to move. Thankfully, you can still wiggle your toes.
		EveSrfLanded = You start to think that it's entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn't hurt to taste it... right?
		EveSrfLanded = "Should I take the left foot or the right foot?" The decision weighs heavy on your shoulders - literally.
		EveSrfLanded = The toss of a pebble suggests that the atmosphere is REALLY, REALLY thick.
		EveSrfLanded = "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!"
		EveSrfLanded = You wonder if you will ever be returning home. Probably not.
		EveSrfSplashed = I feel like my helmet is dissolving. Oh wait... IT IS! Get me back in, now!
		EveSrfSplashed = You had a dream like this once. Unlike the dream, however, this isn't grape soda, and robot dolphins are not swimming in it.
		EveSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could light the ocean on fire.
		EveFlyingLow = "Nuts."
		EveFlyingLow = "I will not give up, I will not give in! I will land boots down, I will stand again."
		EveFlyingLow = "Come on, cosmos! Do your worst!"
		EveFlyingLow = "It has been an honor."
		EveFlyingLow = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.
		EveInSpaceLow = "I left the stove on!"
		EveInSpaceHigh = From this position you can clearly make out lakes and oceans of some kind on the surface below.
