		  EveSrfLandedLowlands = You start laughing at the abnormally high reading as you realize you're going to be stuck here for a long time.
		  EveSrfLandedLowlands = You calculate the amount of DeltaV just to escape the atmosphere is greater than that it took to both escape Kerbin's and get here!
		  EveSrfLandedLowlands = You tap the glass of the barometer. Nope, it's not broken.
		  EveSrfLandedLowlands = It's over 9000...m/s! Well, the DeltaV required to escape the atmosphere anyways.
		  EveFlyingLow = You secretly wish your friends and family the best as landing here may be the last landing you'll ever make.
