                BopSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner seems split between Jool and Bop. You put it down to a defect.
                BopSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner refuses to point at Bop. After frantic calls to the manufacturer, Mission Control tells you that it is rated to high.
                BopInSpaceLowPeaks = The peaks seem rather close. The gravity scanner agrees.
                BopInSpaceLowPeaks = Scanning returns a result of "0".
                BopInSpaceHighPeaks = The scanner is still pointing at Jool.
                BopInSpaceHighPeaks = What does this "%NaN%" mean? Mission Control tells you to watch out for Krakens.
