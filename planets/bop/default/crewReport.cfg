		BopInSpace = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
		BopInSpace = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because you’ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
		BopInSpace = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can't help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
		BopInSpace = Stuck in an eccentric, inclined orbit, this rock offers nothing to look at. A complete waste of time.
		BopInSpace = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
		BopInSpace = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it's hiding some dark secret...
		BopSrfLanded = You're not sure why, but this place gives you an eerie feeling.
		BopSrfLanded = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.
		BopSrfLanded = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.
		BopSrfLanded = You smell squid. The pilot must be eating sushi. What else could it be?
		BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.
