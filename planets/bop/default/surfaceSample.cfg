		BopSrfLanded = Just under the brown surface you find a black, glassy material and put it in the sample bag. A volcanic residue perhaps?
		BopSrfLanded = As you take a sample, it begins to glow... and starts shaking. It clearly does not like being contained.
		BopSrfLanded = The soil here is surprisingly soft, like play-koh.
		BopSrfLanded = The brown dust stains all the parts of your suit that it comes in contact with. Mission Control finds this quite amusing. You’re sure the laundry team will not.
		BopSrfLanded = You dig through the surface and find a sphere that looks a bit like an egg.
		BopSrfLanded = You pick up a rock from the ground. It looks somewhat unusual so you put it into the container.
		BopSrfLanded = The rocks lying around look very dull and in no way remind you of potatoes. You shove one into your sample container, just to pass time.
		BopSrfLanded = You pick up an orange mineral. It appears to be soft and very moist.
