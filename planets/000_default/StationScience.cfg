		TyloSrfLanded = The plants grow low to the ground.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[retrogradeKuarqs]]
{
	!RESULTS {}
	RESULTS
	{
		// default
		default = You note the characteristics of the retrograde kuarqs.
		KerbinInSpace = These kuarqs, along with prograde kuarqs, appear to be the main components of ordinary matter, yet are unstable. This may explain all the explosions.
		MunInSpace = The kuarqs seem to think the Mun is made of cheese. You're pretty sure they're wrong.
		MunSrfLanded = The kuarqs seem to acknowledge their mistake.
		MinmusInSpace = You think the kuarqs are hungry, but you're not sure what to feed them.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The kuarqs seem disappointed that Minmus apparently isn't edible.
		SunInSpace = These kuarqs don't last long, but they seem to cherish every moment. We could learn a lot from them.
		MohoInSpace = The kuarqs seem thirsty.
		EveInSpace = The kuarqs appear certain that the oceans here are blueberry syrup. 
		GillyInSpace = Even you have to seriously consider the kuarqs' potato hypothesis.
		DunaInSpace = The kuarqs seem to think you're orbiting a tomato.
		IkeInSpace = The kuarqs seem to think there's an olive in a polar orbit around Ike.
		DresInSpace = The kuarqs seem to want some tea. You wonder where you'd get a teapot out here.
		JoolInSpace = From up here, the kuarqs feel truly tiny.
		LaytheInSpace = The kuarqs seem to want to sip pina coladas on the beaches below.
		VallInSpace = The kuarqs seem think this moon is made of sherbet.
		TyloInSpace = The kuarqs don't seem to see much point in going down there.
		BopInSpace = Something below is giving the kuarqs the heebie jeebies. For once, they seem to have lost their appetite.
		PolInSpace = The kuarqs don't seem to be interested in this place.
		EelooInSpace = The kuarqs all scream for ice cream.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[eccentricKuarqs]]
{
	!RESULTS {}
	RESULTS
	{
		// default
		default = The kuarqs note your characteristics.
		KerbinInSpace = The kuarqs seem to prefer the term "free-spirited".
		MunInSpace = The kuarqs are suspicious of the Mun's perfectly circular, non-inclined orbit. It strikes them as highly improbable.
		MunSrfLanded = The kuarqs seem to find the frequency of craters a little excessive.
		MinmusInSpace = The kuarqs are quite certain that the moon below is impossible and refuse to acknowledge its existence.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You might think landing on it might convince them that Minmus exists, but it just seems to galvanize their opposition to the idea.
		SunInSpace = According to the kuarqs, the Sun has too little mass to support fusion and produce light of this spectra.
		MohoInSpace = The kuarqs seem to think that the planet below should be precessing. Something about "curved spacetime". What nonsense is that?
		EveInSpace = The kuarqs insist that the planet below should be superheated by a runaway greenhouse effect.
		GillyInSpace = The kuarqs question why none of the "captured asteroid" moons in this solar system orbit retrograde.
		DunaInSpace = The kuarqs are quite content here.
		IkeInSpace = The kuarqs find the lack of impact craters on Ike a stretch to credibility.
		DresInSpace = The kuarqs don't understand why this is called a "dwarf planet" when it has obviously cleared its neighborhood.
		JoolInSpace = The kuarqs keep asking about a "great red spot". You're not sure what they're talking about.
		LaytheInSpace = The kuarqs won't even discuss this moon.
		VallInSpace = The kuarqs say you should attempt no landings here.
		TyloInSpace = The kuarqs keep asking where the atmosphere went.
		BopInSpace = The kuarqs seem fixated on something near the north pole.
		PolInSpace = The kuarqs find the topology of this moon highly unlikely.
		EelooInSpace = The kuarqs are disappointed there aren't more planets between this one and Jool.
