		// default
		default = SCANSat altimetry low resolution scanner is reporting in. I don't know how, but we have a strong signal and are getting data. This calls for a celebratory round of snacks!
		default = Analyzed low resolution altimetry data.
		
		// Sun (Kerbol)
		Sun = You wonder if the sensor is malfunctioning.
		
		// Moho
		Moho = Well, at least this low resolution data makes Moho look kind of cool. Not quite giant lakes of lava, but still cool.
		
		// Eve
		Eve = You contemplate the grainy, rough altitude estimates returned by the scanner and wish that you had sent the high resolution scanner instead. Oh well, it's a great reason to launch more rockets! (As if we really needed a reason anyway)
		
		// Gilly
		Gilly = Your low resolution scanning confirms what you already knew: Gilly is just a lumpy rock floating in space. At least you don't have to strain your eyes looking at the report.
		
		// Kerbin
		Kerbin = Even this low resolution data of the planets surface is amazingly useful. You can't wait to deploy this technology on the Mun or beyond.
		
		// Mun
		Mun = The data shows broad, sweeping strokes of the landscape below. A high resolution scan would be more helpful, but you can probably find a suitable landing site using this data.
		
		// Minmus
		Minmus = You grudgingly acknowledge that the guys over at the Kerbal Astronomical Society were right: Minmus really is a moon. You wouldn't have believed it if you hadn't seen the altimetry scan with your own eyes.
		
		// Duna
		Duna = This low resolution data is a bit grainy and distorted, but it will still be invaluable in searching for a proper landing site on Duna. Suddenly a long-term Duna mission just became a real prospect.
		
		// Ike
		Ike = As you pore over the data you are struck by how similar Ike appears to the Mun. You wonder about their comparative surface geology.
		
		// Dres
		Dres = Even with the low resolution scanner it is quite apparent that Dres has some prominent mountains. You can't wait for the resource scan results because you're sure "there's gold in them there hills".
		
		// Jool
		Jool = Altimetry, what altimetry? It's a gas giant for Kerbal's sake. Let's just pick a number at random and call it good.
		
		// Laythe
		Laythe = The sensor seems unable to penetrate the water.
		
		// Vall
		Vall = Well, here it is: "The data you Vall been waiting for! Hahahahaha! Hahaha. Ha. Ha? What, SOMEONE has to find that funny."
		
		// Tylo
		Tylo = You're still not sure what the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall, and Jool overhead would be like, but this data will sure help you find a landing site so that you can find out.
		
		// Bop
		Bop = Well, the low resolution altimetry data is in, and you decide to package it up and send it back to KSC. You just hope that there is enough juice left in the batteries to get it all sent and keep basic systems running at the same time.
		
		// Pol
		Pol = The low resolution scan confirms that Pol does indeed look like a giant pollen grain. Until you upgrade to a high resolution scan, and advance the field of electron microscopy, you will still be left with the question of how strong this resemblance truly is.
		
		// Eeloo
		Eeloo = The scientists back on Kerbin have been waiting for this data for a long time. No doubt there will be celebrations and snacks for all when it gets there.

	RESULTS
	{
		// default
		default = The high resolution sensor DEFINATELY wasn't meant to function at this altitude. Oh well, as long as it gives us data, and we have plenty of snacks to eat, all is well.
		default = Analyzed high resolution altimetry data.
		
		// Sun (Kerbol)
		Sun = You realize that you could have saved some money if you had trusted the low resolution sensor in the first place.
		
		// Moho
		Moho = Finally, the awesomeness has returned to Moho! It may not be giant flowing rivers of lava, but this SCANSat data is spectacular!
		
		// Eve
		Eve = The high resolution sensor cut through the hazy purple atmosphere well, and you are able to distinguish minute details on the surface. The scientists back at KSC will be relieved.
		
		// Gilly
		Gilly = Even in super-high resolution Gilly somehow seems to be in low resolution. That is one seriously lumpy surface.
		
		// Kerbin
		Kerbin = You become mesmerised by all the colors in the data that the new high resolution SCANSat technology provides. Suddenly Mission Control awakes you from your stupor, and you quickly wipe the drool from the corner of your mouth.
		
		// Mun
		Mun = Hah! No more boring grey moon. Just look at all the colors in that scan! Now we can really pinpoint a prime landing site.
		
		// Minmus
		Minmus = Wow, not only is Minmus real, it has some amazing topography! You can't wait to land in one of those flat areas.
		
		// Duna
		Duna = This high resolution data is amazing. You begin analyzing the hills and valleys, searching for the perfect landing spot.
		
		// Ike
		Ike = The data confirms the presence of large sloping hills and craters. Hopefully the analysts back at KSC can use this to find a suitable landing place.
		
		// Dres
		Dres = Those... are some serious mountains. You are glad to be analysing this data, rather than trying to climb up some of those hills.
		
		// Jool
		Jool = Even in high resolution there does not appear to be a surface to Jool. So much for that theory. At least we still have the grant money!
		
		// Laythe
		Laythe = The map shows mostly negative heights. You consider draining Laythe just so you can climb it's mountains.
		
		// Vall
		Vall = The data from the high resolution scanner confirms that the surface of Vall is, indeed, "crinkly". Guess Gene owes you fifty funds.
		
		// Tylo
		Tylo = Tylo may have been the first of Jool's moons to be discovered, but this data makes it feel like you are discovering the moon for the first time.
		
		// Bop
		Bop = Wow, look at all those colors. You have no idea what all that data means, but you're sure that this high resolution data will impress everyone back at KSC.
		
		// Pol
		Pol = Even with this amount of high-quality data it is still difficult to find a suitable landing site. How the heck was this moon made, anyway?
		
		// Eeloo
		Eeloo = The cracks and fissures on the surface stand out in striking detail as you examine the data from the SCANSat altimeter. Just look at all those potential landing sites.

	RESULTS
	{
		// default
		default = Wow, how are we even receiving this data right now? Those SCANSat engineers really know what they are doing. Either that or they have not the slightest idea what they are doing. Either way, it's time for some snacks!
		default = Analyzed multispectral sensor data.
		
		// Sun (Kerbol)
		Sun = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
		Sun = you wonder why there are no Poles visible on the biome map.
		
		// Moho
		Moho = As you pore through the data you wonder if you will find the elusive lava lake biome that so many scientists had speculated about.
		
		// Eve
		Eve = The intricately swirled lines of Eve's biome map remind you of lava lamps and tie dyed shirts. Man those were the days. Next spacecraft to Eve will have a mandatory disco ball!
		
		// Gilly
		Gilly = Even with all that squinting those astronomers couldn't see the biomes here. Hah! Dumb astronomers! That's +1 for science and 0 for uhhhh... science.
		
		// Kerbin
		Kerbin = This SCANSat biome data is truly astounding. You just hope that it is crumb-resistant, as you remember eating a particularly messy box of snacks the day that the sensor was installed.
		
		// Mun
		Mun = Huh, never knew the moon had biomes. Wonder which one the cheese is in. And if there are any other snacks there as well.
		
		// Minmus
		Minmus = You contemplate how fitting the name "Greater Flats" is as you pore over the data. Whoever thinks up these names is one smart Kerbal, unlike the engineers we have around here.
		
		// Duna
		Duna = You comb through the biome data looking for just the right spot to gather all that sweet, sweet science data from. Mmmmm, science... and snacks.
		
		// Ike
		Ike = As you pore over the data coming back from Ike you are surprised at the biome diversity. After all it's just a moon. You cant wait to get your hands on some of the scientific data locked up down there.
		
		// Dres
		Dres = Poles, check. Highlands, check. Midlands, check. Lowlands, check. Ridges, check. Impact Ejecta, check. Impact Craters, check. Canyons, check. I think we got it all. Time to shut down the scanner and have some snacks!
		
		// Jool
		Jool = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
		Jool = you wonder why there are no Poles visible on the biome map.
		
		// Laythe
		Laythe = You want to throw a party every time the sensor detects a land biome.
		
		// Vall
		Vall = Pretty straightforward data: Poles, Highlands, Midlands, and Lowlands. That's a wrap. Now let's have some snacks!
		
		// Tylo
		Tylo = You are struck by the diversity of the biomes in the report. Not only is Tylo cool to look up from, it's cool to look down at too.
		
		// Bop
		Bop = This detailed analysis of Bop's biomes will advance our understanding of the little moon beyond anything we could have hoped. It's been a great day. Snacks all around!
		
		// Pol
		Pol = As you take in the biome data coming from Pol you begin to contemplate the possibility that pollen grains have biomes to. Then you quickly squash the thought, knowing what the activists would be like if they got a hold of that idea.
		
		// Eeloo
		Eeloo = It is astounding to have such detailed biome data on a planet so far from Kerbin. You gaze in awe at the report as the data comes in.
