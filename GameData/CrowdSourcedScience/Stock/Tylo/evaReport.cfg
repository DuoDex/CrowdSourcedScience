        TyloSrfLanded = They say the gravity of Tylo adds five pounds.

        TyloSrfLandedMidlands = If surface composition is of any indication, there is a distinct possibility of finding underground lakes and caverns somewhere around.

        TyloSrfLandedHighlands = Is it me, or did my spacesuit just get really heavy?

        TyloSrfLandedLowlands = You try jumping... It isn't very effective

        TyloSrfLandedMara = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.

        TyloInSpaceLow = You swear you just found Tylo's missing atmosphere! It's just too bad it floated away before you could grab it.
