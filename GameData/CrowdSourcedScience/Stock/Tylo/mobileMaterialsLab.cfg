        TyloSrfLanded* = It seems as if the samples have put on some weight.

        //TyloSrfLandedMidlands* =

        TyloSrfLandedHighlands* = The samples look very similar to peanut butter. Then you realize this isn't a sample canister and someone got peanut butter all over your materials!

        //TyloSrfLandedLowlands* =

        TyloSrfLandedMara* = The samples appear to have started a corporate oligarchy. You're not sure how, but the container is now full of mines and factories.

        //TyloSrfLandedMinorCraters* =
        //TyloSrfLandedTychoCrater* =
        //TyloSrfLandedGalileioCrater* =
        //TyloSrfLandedGrissomCrater* =
        //TyloSrfLandedGagarinCrater* =

        //TyloInSpaceLow* =

        TyloInSpaceHigh* = The metal is metallic, the wood is wooden, the glass is glassy. If Tylo is going change any of this you will have to get closer.
