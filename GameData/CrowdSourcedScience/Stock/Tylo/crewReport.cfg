        TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.

        //TyloSrfLandedMidlands =

        TyloSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity is quite heavy and reminds you of home.

        TyloSrfLandedLowlands = You can't walk a few meters without your face becoming friends with the surface. It is a little agitating.

        TyloSrfLandedMara = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.

        //TyloSrfLandedMinorCraters =
        //TyloSrfLandedTychoCrater =
        //TyloSrfLandedGalileioCrater =
        //TyloSrfLandedGrissomCrater =

        TyloInSpaceLow = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesn't have an atmosphere.
        TyloInSpaceLow = The crew wonders why they even need to land on this miserable rock.

        TyloInSpaceHigh = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
        TyloInSpaceHigh = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
