    {
        PolSrfLanded = Apart from the occasional Kerbal falling down the cliff, there is nothing for the seismometer to detect.

        PolSrfLandedPoles = There seems to be a lot of seismic activity around Pol's poles.

        PolSrfLandedLowlands = These results are gibberish! The interior of this little moon must be messier than Bob's office.

        PolSrfLandedHighlands = After squinting at the device, you can still see vibrations from your landing on the screen, circling the (very tiny) globe.

        PolSrfLandedMidlands = The sensor registers very weak vibrations, which could provide a clue as to why Pol is that crumbled up.
