        LaytheSrfLanded* = You detect massive fluctuations as Jool tugs on the moon's surface.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
        LaytheSrfLandedPoles* = Shaking the scanner does not seem to budge it. Instead you get out a golf ball and club. Gravity must be weaker than on Kerbin because you just hit it far enough for a hole in one!

        LaytheSrfLandedShores* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        //LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay* =

        LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea* = There does appear to be some gravity here.

        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland* =
        //LaytheSrfLandedShallows* =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterBay* = The gravity scan reads 69. You, for no reason at all, say "nice."
        //LaytheSrfLandedDeGrasseSea* =
        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks* =

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes* =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea* = Theinstrument shorts out before you can get an accurate reading.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks* =

        LaytheInSpaceLowPoles* = Your scanner shows that the gravitational draw of this moon does not change wherever you go. The water makes the planet smoother than a baby Kerbal's bottom.

        LaytheInSpaceLowShores* = You drop your pencil and it floats gently way.

        //LaytheInSpaceLowDunes* =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowCrescentBay* =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea* =
