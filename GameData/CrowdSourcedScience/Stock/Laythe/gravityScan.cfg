        LaytheSrfLanded = You detect massive fluctuations as Jool tugs on the moon's surface.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Shaking the scanner does not seem to budge it. Instead you get out a golf ball and club. Gravity must be weaker than on Kerbin because you just hit it far enough for a hole in one!

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        //LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay =

        LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea = There does appear to be some gravity here.

        //LaytheSrfLandedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterBay =

        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = Theinstrument shorts out before you can get an accurate reading.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks =

        LaytheInSpaceLowPoles = Your scanner shows that the gravitational draw of this moon does not change wherever you go. The water makes the planet smoother than a baby Kerbal's bottom.

        LaytheInSpaceLowShores = You drop your pencil and it floats gently way.

        //LaytheInSpaceLowDunes =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowCrescentBay =
