        LaytheSrfLanded = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = You are amazed by how similar the readings are to Kerbin.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!

        //LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland =

        //LaytheSrfLandedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.

        LaytheFlyingLowPoles = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.

        LaytheFlyingLowShores = There's Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and lots of water. You scribble down a note: "Invest in colonization program."

        LaytheFlyingLowDunes = The atmosphere appears to be made up of oxygen and nitrogen. You wonder at the high chlorine content, though.

        //LaytheFlyingLowCrescentBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowTheSagenSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterIsland =
        //LaytheFlyingLowShallows =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.

        LaytheFlyingHighPoles = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photo-dissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.

        LaytheFlyingHighShores = The preliminary readings show an atmosphere nearly identical to Kerbin.

        LaytheFlyingHighDunes = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.

        //LaytheFlyingHighCrescentBay =
        //LaytheFlyingHighTheSagenSea =
        //LaytheFlyingHighCraterIsland =
