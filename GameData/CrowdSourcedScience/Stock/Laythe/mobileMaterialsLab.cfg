        LaytheSrfLanded = Some of the samples spill and soak into the soil. You silently pray that the samples are sterile.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Some of the samples seem to be frozen.

        LaytheSrflandedShores = The Mobile Materials Lab hums and whirs as it processes the sand you shoveled into it.
        LaytheSrfLandedShores = One of the samples vaporized.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = You put a sand-like substance into the Mobile Materials lab. It hums and whirs for some time and then it beeps. The screen says "Sand".

        LaytheSrfSplashed = Certain samples react explosively with Laythe's oceans. Or perhaps the sensor is reacting explosively? It's hard to tell.

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = The Goo seems to be afraid of water.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = It is starting to rust.
        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = Despite the temperature one of the samples is starting to glow hot as it touches the water.

        LaytheFlyingLow = The materials suddenly gather by the window, looking at the surface below.
        LaytheFlyingLow = They look the same as they were on Kerbin.
