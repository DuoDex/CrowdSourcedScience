        LaytheSrfLanded* = Some of the samples spill and soak into the soil. You silently pray that the samples are sterile.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles* = Some of the samples seem to be frozen.
		LaytheSrfLandedPoles* = Snow suddenly blows into some of the samples. You hope it doesn't effect the results.

        LaytheSrflandedShores* = The Mobile Materials Lab hums and whirs as it processes the sand you shoveled into it.
        LaytheSrfLandedShores* = One of the samples vaporized.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes* = You put a sand-like substance into the Mobile Materials lab. It hums and whirs for some time and then it beeps. The screen says "Sand".

        LaytheSrfSplashed* = Certain samples react explosively with Laythe's oceans. Or perhaps the sensor is reacting explosively? It's hard to tell.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores* =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes* =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay* = The Goo seems to be afraid of water.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea* = It is starting to rust.
        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea* = Despite the temperature one of the samples is starting to glow hot as it touches the water.

        LaytheFlyingLow* = The materials suddenly gather by the window, looking at the surface below.
        LaytheFlyingLow* = They look the same as they were on Kerbin.

        //LaytheFlyingHigh* =

        //LaytheInSpaceLow* =
