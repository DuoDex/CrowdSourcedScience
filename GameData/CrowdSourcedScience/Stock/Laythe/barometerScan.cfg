        LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is lower than on Kerbin, but you don't think seasoned mountaineers would have any trouble adapting to it.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = The readings are almost the same as on a sunny beach back home. It makes you feel like going for a swim.

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = Atmospheric pressure is a bit lower than on Kerbin. You are unsure if that makes it more fun or not.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = For a couple of seconds you think the device is still displaying readings taken on Kerbin.

        LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay = The barometer predicts rain.

        LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea = The atmosphere here is unusually dense.

        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfLandedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfLandedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks =

        LaytheSrfSplashed = Atmospheric pressure at sea level is quite high, but still less than on Kerbin. Well, it's a moon, give it a break!

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = You contemplate dunking the scanner to see if it can measure depth, but Mission Control says that will void the warranty.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = The pressure seems higher over the water.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
        LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
        LaytheFlyingLow = If this atmosphere had oxygen, you could take off your helmet and crack a window.

        LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarefied, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.

        //LaytheInSpaceLow =

        //LaytheInSpaceHigh =
