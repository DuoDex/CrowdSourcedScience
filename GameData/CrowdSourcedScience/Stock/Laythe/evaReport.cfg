        LaytheSrfLanded = You feel a slight tremor. Perhaps you should have landed on that OTHER island.
        LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet's protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe Kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
        LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it's because of lower oxygen content.
        LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
        LaytheSrfLanded = You wonder for a moment whether it would be safe or not to open the seal on your helmet. After a moment of consideration, you decide to play it safe and leave the helmet on.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Can I take off my spacesuit?

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = Looking beyond the horizon, you conclude that this is a perfect place to set up a base for.
		LaytheSrfLandedShores = You are glad to see the solid ground, but it seems that after such a long journey you almost forgot how to walk.
		LaytheSrfLandedShores = This would make a great beach resort!

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = You wonder if you could swim to the next island from here.

        LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay = You feel drunk because of the thin air. Mission Control asks you to put your helmet back on.

        LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea = There might be good diving on this planet. Unfortunately, Mission Control did not pack any flippers.

        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks =

        LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could swim to the nearest island.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You realize that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You attempt to drink some water. Then you remember the co-worker who died after ordering some "H2O too".
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You tread water. Perhaps you should have chosen a drier landing spot.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Swimming is really hard in these suits you know.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = The low land to water ratio and sedate water cycle of Laythe combine to give its oceans low salinity. You're forced to constantly swim to keep afloat.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = You begin to wish you'd brought a boat.
		LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = You wonder what lies beneath this liquid, is this water?

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingLow = Now I really wish I had brought that parachute.

        LaytheFlyingLowPoles = You realize that you forgot to bring sunscreen.

        LaytheFlyingLowShores = You are sorely tempted to remove your helmet.

        LaytheFlyingLowDunes = You feel comfortable, back at Kerbin after such a long sleep. Wait a minute...

        LaytheFlyingLowCrescentBay = You find that changes in your environment oddly turn your thoughts rapidly from desserts towards life insurances.

        LaytheFlyingLowTheSagenSea = It is much colder here than the scan from orbit suggested.

        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterIsland =
        //LaytheFlyingLowShallows =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingHigh = As you repair one of the heat shielding tiles that fell off, you are reminded of your first return through Kerbin's' atmosphere.

        LaytheInSpaceLow = As you gaze down upon the flowing waters of Laythe, you discover that you need a toilet.

        LaytheInSpaceLowPoles = You search the sky, hoping to see Jool.

        LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The air looks tolerable and the water looks very inviting. A beautiful place to be!

        LaytheInSpaceLowDunes = Your Geiger Counter is emitting a continuous hum. Time to flee.

        LaytheInSpaceLowCrescentBay = Gazing around the landscape, you feel very homesick.

        LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = As much as you'd like to find life, the only green wiggling creature here is in a spacesuit.

        //LaytheInSpaceLowCraterIsland =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowShallows =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowCraterBay =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheInSpaceLowPeaks =

        LaytheInSpaceHigh = You almost feel like you are floating above Kerbin.
