        LaytheSrfLanded* = The Goo seems excited by the climate.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles* = The Goo seems excited. Perhaps it wants to swim in the ocean?

        LaytheSrfLandedShores* = The Goo bubbles and burps a little.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes* = The Goo twists into strange and frightening forms, possibly due to a strong magnetic field on this moon.

        LaytheSrfLandedPeaks* = The Goo is forming shapes that mimic the terrain nearby. You conclude it likes this location.

        LaytheFlyingLow* = You note that the mystery goo Containment Unit is wobbling a little. Is that the Goo? Or is it just the screws coming loose?
        LaytheFlyingLow* = The Goo seems to be shivering. Perhaps the draft is making it cold?

        LaytheFlyingHigh* = There does not seem to be much activity coming from the Containment Unit. Only close examination reveals a slight pulsing.
