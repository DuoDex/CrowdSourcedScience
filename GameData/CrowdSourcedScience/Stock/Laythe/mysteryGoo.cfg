        LaytheSrfLanded = The Goo seems excited by the climate.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = The Goo seems excited. Perhaps it wants to swim in the ocean?

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = The Goo bubbles and burps a little.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The Goo twists into strange and frightening forms, possibly due to a strong magnetic field on this moon.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = The Goo has decided to go for a short swim.
        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = It bounces around from excitement... or it might be just the waves.

        LaytheFlyingLow = You note that the mystery goo Containment Unit is wobbling a little. Is that the Goo? Or is it just the screws coming loose?
        LaytheFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be shivering. Perhaps the draft is making it cold?

        LaytheFlyingHigh = There does not seem to be much activity coming from the Containment Unit. Only close examination reveals a slight pulsing.
        LaytheFlyingHigh = The Goo is pulsing gently. It is 15% more radioactive than when in Laythe's atmosphere.

        LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems right at home in space.
        LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems comfortable.
