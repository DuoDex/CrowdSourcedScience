        LaytheSrfLanded = It's quite cold here. You would definitely need some warm clothes if you were ever to walk around without your spacesuit.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Kerbol looks smaller than you remember, it is not sending much heat to the surface. Why does the water stay liquid?

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = Is the mercury still there?
        LaytheSrfLandedShores = The temperature is very similar to that of a refrigerator on steroids, lots of them.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Kerbol is small in the sky, but the sand is much warmer than the air. You could almost take your boots off!

        LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay = It's just above the freezing point of water here. A hot beverage would fit in well.

        //LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfLandedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfLandedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks =

        LaytheSrfSplashed = The temperatures here are below water's freezing point. Clearly, the water here has odd characteristics.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = Temperatures are similar to those of Kerbin's polar regions. The water hasn't frozen, though, most probably due to the high salinity.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = You wonder why the water isn't frozen.
		LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = The temperature is similar to being in a freezer.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.

        LaytheFlyingLowPoles = Your temperature scan shows that it is too cold to pop a window open.

        LaytheFlyingLowShores = Kerbol is small but bright. The cockpit glass is very cold when you touch it.

        //LaytheFlyingLowDunes =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCrescentBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowTheSagenSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterIsland =
        //LaytheFlyingLowShallows =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingHigh = The temperature fluctuates more than expected.
        LaytheFlyingHigh = The thermometer is near -40c. That's as cold as the Kerbin South Pole!

        LaytheInSpaceLow = You forgot to cap your drink and it floated away. When you licked up the spill, your tongue froze to the radio panel. Mission Control asked if you were under attack by aliens.
        LaytheInSpaceLow = The temperature here looks much the same as anywhere else in space, a few degrees above absolute zero.

        //LaytheInSpaceHigh =
