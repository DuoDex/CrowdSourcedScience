        LaytheSrfLanded = The seismic graph is going crazy. The Joolian system seems to be subjecting Laythe to an unholy chiropractic session.
        LaytheSrfLanded = You notice the ground starting to shake. You might want to leave soon.
        LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's surface stretches and flexes under the strain of tidal forces from Jool.
        LaytheSrfLanded = The sensor is detecting heavy seismic activity deep below the surface. Perhaps Laythe has previously undetected volcanic activity. Only time will tell.
        LaytheSrfLanded = You've set the craft right on top of a fault line! You find this both fascinating and absolutely terrifying.
        LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe shows some very important seismic activity. You're not sure the craft can survive a tsunami, but at least it keeps the moon temperate.
        LaytheSrfLanded = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Fluctuations within the planet's core are detected as signs of the tidal forces exerted by Jool.

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = The detector picks up a seismic anomaly! You feel shaken.
        LaytheSrfLandedShores = Waves breaking on the shore is interfering with the sensitivity of your instrument.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Seismic scan reports distant booms, both under the ocean and on the surface. They seem to be volcanoes.
