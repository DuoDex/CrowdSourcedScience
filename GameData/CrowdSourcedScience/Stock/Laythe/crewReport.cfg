        LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.

        LaytheSrfLandedPoles = One day we will have a permanent base here. One day.

        LaytheSrfLandedShores = It appears that we are very much on the ground right now.

        LaytheSrfLandedDunes = You wonder if you just could sit on the beach, relax, and have a margarita.

        LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay = After hearing the air is breathable, you open your space helmet, only to find that breathable does not mean odorless or pleasant.

        LaytheSrfLandedTheSagenSea = As you look out the window, you see something glowing below you. You decide it's probably best to get to shore as soon as possible.

        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfLandedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfLandedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfLandedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfLandedPeaks =

        LaytheSrfSplashed = Looking at the map of Laythe to figure out which of the islands is the closest, you know it'll be a long swim for any chance of rescue.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedPoles =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShores =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDunes =

        LaytheSrfSplashedCrescentBay = You suddenly realize that you forgot to bring your towel.

        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = You wish you had brought a boat.
        LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSea = You thought you saw something moving in the water. Leaving the capsule might not be a good idea.

        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterIsland =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedShallows =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedCraterBay =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheSrfSplashedPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingLow = Are you sure we aren't on Kerbin?

        LaytheFlyingLowPoles = You started daydreaming about being the captain of the Space Battleship 'Spirit of Kerbin', until being woken up by a beeping sound.

        LaytheFlyingLowShores = The ocean looks inviting. You realize that you forgot your swimsuit. Oh well, Mission Control would never have approved.

        LaytheFlyingLowDunes = The crew deliberates heavily on the correct way to pronounce 'Laythe'.

        LaytheFlyingLowCrescentBay = The atmosphere appears to have blocked most of Jool's radiation at this altitude. You hope your tan doesn't suffer as a result.

        LaytheFlyingLowTheSagenSea = You look at the moon below and feel homesick.

        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterIsland =
        //LaytheFlyingLowShallows =
        //LaytheFlyingLowCraterBay =
        //LaytheFlyingLowDeGrasseSea =
        //LaytheFlyingLowPeaks =

        LaytheFlyingHigh = Readings for alpha and beta radiation are low here, but there are still elevated readings for X-Rays and gamma radiation.

        LaytheInSpaceLow = Your radiation instruments are showing some strange results. Perhaps Laythe has a magnetic field that is interacting with Jool's.
        LaytheInSpaceLow = You start to think how lucky you are that the Radiation Belt DLC for life isn't out yet.

        LaytheInSpaceHigh = The radiation here must be intense. You are glad the cockpit of your spacecraft is heavily shielded.
        LaytheInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at Laythe, you begin to wonder whether Kerbin is the only planet harboring life.
        LaytheInSpaceHigh = As the crew look down upon Laythe, they are reminded of home and the huge distance they have traveled.
        LaytheInSpaceHigh = You know this blue liquid can't be water. This moon is outside the habatible zone.
