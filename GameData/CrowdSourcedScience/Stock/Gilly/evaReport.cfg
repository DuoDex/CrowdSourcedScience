    %RESULTS
    {
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = You try to walk, but instead go several meters into the air. It takes minutes before you float back down.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = The seemingly conflictory orientations of things confuse you, and you fall over in very slow motion.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = You balance yourself on your pinky finger and start doing push-ups, only to find yourself slowly floating away.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = Walk very slowly... Oh no! You tripped.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = It takes a while to get used to the idea of kilometer-long jumps.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = Using your RCS systems for balance, you manage to walk along the surface using only two fingers.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = We could really use some anchors here.

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = If only the launchpad had been here instead of KSC, this whole space thing would've been so much easier. You make a note to berate the administrators back home over their poor choice.
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = One small step for Kerbal, one giant leap for WHAAAAA!
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = That rock you threw is still going...
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface.
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = You probably shouldn't jump. You might not come back down.

        GillyInSpaceLowMidlands = No gravity? No problem!
        GillyInSpaceLowMidlands = It's easy to fly away from things, but just as easy to jet back over.

        GillyInSpaceLowLowlands = You think you can jet-pack into orbit ten times over.
        GilleInSpaceLowMidlands = You ask Mission Control if you could pleeeeease be allowed to jetpack between the surface and orbit?

        GillyInSpaceLowHighlands = You wonder how awesome it would be to make a jump with a rover from the hills here.
        GillyInSpaceLowHighlands = You try to touch a passing peak. Mission Control tells you to go back into your capsule and raise your damn orbit.

        GillyInSpaceHigh = Looking down, you see the two moons of Eve. As you are about to record the new satellite, you realize that one of the two is, in fact, a speck of dust.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = "Wait... there's a planet below me? Does it even have gravity?"
        GillyInSpaceHigh = The terrain grades in colour between tan and light brown.
