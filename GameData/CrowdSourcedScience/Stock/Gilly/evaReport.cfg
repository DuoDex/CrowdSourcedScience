    {
        GillySrfLanded = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
        GillySrfLanded = You balance yourself on your pinky finger and start doing push-ups, only to find yourself slowly floating away.
        GillySrfLanded = Using your RCS systems for balance, you manage to walk along the surface using only two fingers.
        GillySrfLanded = We could really use some anchors here.
        GillySrfLanded = You try to walk, but instead go several meters into the air. It takes minutes before you float back down.
        GillySrfLanded = Walk very slowly... Oh no! You tripped.
        GillySrfLanded = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface.
        GillySrfLanded = You probably shouldn't jump. You might not come back down.
        GillySrfLanded = One small step for Kerbal, one giant leap for WHAAAAA!
        GillySrfLanded = That rock you threw is still going...
        GillySrfLanded = It takes a while to get used to the idea of kilometer-long jumps.

        GillySrfLandedMidlands = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = "Wait... there's a planet below me? Does it even have gravity?"

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = If only the launchpad had been here instead of KSC, this whole space thing would've been so much easier. You make a note to berate the administrators back home over their poor choice.

        GillyInSpaceLow = You try to touch a passing peak. Mission Control tells you to go back into your capsule and raise your damn orbit.

        GillyInSpaceLowMidlands = No gravity? No problem!

        GillyInSpaceLowLowlands = You think you can jet-pack into orbit ten times over.

        GillyInSpaceLowHighlands = You wonder how awesome it would be to make a jump with a rover from the hills here.

		GillyInSpaceHigh = Looking down, you see the two moons of Eve. As you are about to record the new satellite, you realize that one of the two is, in fact, a speck of dust.
