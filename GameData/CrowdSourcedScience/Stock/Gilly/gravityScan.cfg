        GillySrfLandedMidlands = Peering very closely at the dial, you notice there's indeed some gravity here.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = You have to tap the sensor a few times before it realizes that gravity is, in fact, present.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = The needle on the gravity sensor seems to have moved about half a millimeter.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = The instrument hardly recognizes the asteroid below.

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = With Gilly's low gravity, you now question why Jeb wanted to put Mainsails on the lander.
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = The gravioli detector reports that there is NO gravity on this dwarf asteroid... wait, there's like 0.01 gravity units here.

        GillyInSpaceLowMidlands = Are you sure the sensor's even working? The numbers are so small they don't register on the cheap LCD.
	GillyInSpaceLowMidlands = The gravimeter threatens to float away in the near-zero-g.

        GillyInSpaceLowLowlands = The display reads "Error HL3". Upon consultation with the manual, you discover that this means the sensor can't find any gravity to scan.
	GillyInSpaceLowLowlands = The sensor outputs a beautifully detailed gravity map - of Eve.

        GillyInSpaceLowHighlands = The gravity scanner can't decide which way is up.
        GillyInSpaceLowHighlands = The gravity scanner decides that the ship has more gravity than Gilly.

        GillyInSpaceHighMidlands = Hey, is this thing on?
        GillyInSpaceHighMidlands = The gravity is ridiculous. Playing ker-ball on Gilly might end up putting the ball in orbit.

        GillyInSpaceHighLowlands = You manage to get an accurate reading despite the overpowering pull from Eve.
	GillyInSpaceHighLowlands = The sensor thinks the most gravity is coming from behind you.

        GillyInSpaceHighHighlands = The readings are so low that the margin of error still touches zero.
	GillyInSpaceHighHighlands = If you squint at the data enough, you think you can see small variations in gravity from the lumpy peaks.
