        GillySrfLandedMidlands = The loose samples take a very long time to roll to the lower end of the bay.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = Some of the samples float out of the materials bay.

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = When disturbed, the objects take a long time to return to the floor in a new and interesting pattern. You wonder if you could sell the Materials Lab as a piece of modern art.

        GillyInSpaceLow = It looks like someone's been trying to hide snacks in the Materials Lab.

        GillyInSpaceHigh = The samples behave in much the same way that they did while in deep space.
