        GillySrfLandedMidlands = This landing spot is definitely not flat, but the gravity is so low it barely matters.
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = A shallow slope can be vertical and vice versa. Gilly has some very confusing geometries from down here.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = You contemplate running around the circular walls of the crew capsule like a caffeinated hamster, to see if it would generate enough force to tip over the lander.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = You feel no change in gravity.

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = You consider going for a hike, but you are afraid that your first step will launch you right off the surface.
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = You feel a surge in gravity. Mentioning nothing to Mission Control, you put on your brown pants.

        GillyInSpaceLow = "I didn't know they made them this small."
        GillyInSpaceLow = You wonder if anything would have a TWR of less than one here.
        GillyInSpaceLow = What is this, a moon for ants?
        GillyInSpaceLow = This place looks a bit boring. You start calculating what it would take to deorbit it into Eve, until your calculator gives you a NaN error. Mission Control refuses to do calculations for you.
        GillyInSpaceLow = It looks small and not very tasty.
        GillyInSpaceLow = You look down to the surface. It's so close! Of course you don't want to end up lithobraking on those hills by accident, but at this speed it probably wouldn't be that bad.
        GillyInSpaceLow = You think you can stick your arm out and touch the surface.

        GillyInSpaceHigh = Somehow your foot has become stuck in the controls. Who has been chewing gum?
        GillyInSpaceHigh = Yup. It's tiny.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = In retrospect, you imagined it to be bigger.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = It looks like a potato. You are starting to feel very hungry.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = A rock so little must have very little gravity. Next time, you'll bring a golf club.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = How cute! Despite its potato-like appearance, Gilly is an adorable little asteroid.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = The color and highly irregular shape of Gilly remind you of a potato. You suddenly wonder where the chips are.
