    {
        GillySrfLandedMidlands = Nil. As though a tiny space potato would ever have an atmosphere.
        GillrSrfLandedMidlands = The tiny gravity isn't even enough to make the needle settle on the bottom of the gauge.

        GillySrfLandedLowlands = There's some dust, but it hardly counts as an atmosphere.
        GillySrfLandedLowlands = You expected more, given how Gilly is so many times bigger than the piddly asteroids flying around.

        GillySrfLandedHighlands = You reach for your notepad to write a zero on, but accidentally bat it across the cabin.
        GillySrfLandedHighlands = Dust kicked up by the spacecraft just doesn't land, and settles in the barometer.

        GillyInSpaceLow = You're barely even an orbit, much less landed and surrounded by air.
        GillyInSpaceLow = You could swear tapping the barometer here would perturb your orbit enough to crash.

        GillyInSpaceHigh = You're more preoccupied with making sure you don't accidentally break Gilly orbit.
        GillyInSpaceHigh = A screw pings out of the barometer housing and drifts slowly down to the surface.
