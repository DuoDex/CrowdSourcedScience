        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = If you didn't know better, you would say the samples were afraid of the darkness. Do you know better?
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The onboard camera shows an alarm clock ringing in the bay. Joke's on you, R&D Department, nobody can hear it!

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The grey rock and dust makes the samples look grey as well.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Grey dust trickles out of the crevices in the sample bay door as it opens.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = For want of a flat place to land around here, the materials slowly slide to the end of the bay.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Dust kicked up by the ship landing starts to cake the samples. This stuff seems pretty sticky and attracted to static.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = One of the samples rolls out of the bay and bounces off down the mountainside. You don't fancy chasing after it.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = No matter the landscape, that ubiquitous sticky dust is all over the samples very quickly.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Dust here settles vertically, rather than on any surface around.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = You forgot to depressurise the bay before opening it, and a mix of gas and samples go flying in an arc to the ground.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = A nearby falling rock makes the samples shake in their containers. You hope your spot isn't next.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Some of the once-liquid samples melt when exposed to the sunlight. It mustn't be too cold, then.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = A small shower of grey dust falls gently to the ground as the sample bay doors open silently in the vacuum.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = Some of the oxygen has leaked out of one of the containers. Closing the doors to preserve the pressure, you heat the Ikean dust in the bay until it ignites.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = You look at the red light in the bay, and then up at Duna. The resemblance is uncanny.
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The samples don't do much aside from bob about in the low gravity.

        IkeInSpaceLow = The samples cluster on the Ike-facing side. They must like Ike too.
        IkeInSpaceLow = You open and shut the doors to make the materials do something. All you succeed in doing is knocking some out.

        IkeInSpaceHigh = Note to installing technicians: this is a science experiment, not a fancy groceries holder. Please leave your karrots somewhere else.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = One of the samples has drifted out of its container. You grab it with the remote arm to put it back in, and it crumbles to dust. Oh well.
