        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = It's quiet. Too quiet. The seismic silence is unsettling.
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Perhaps seismic waves don't reach these latitudes, since you aren't getting much at all.

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The seismometer picks up faint signals from tidal deformation reflecting around inside the moon.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = More pings are detected from the Duna-facing side of Ike, and even more at periapsis.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = There is no sign of volcanic activity, but the surface is undergoing tidal stress from Duna's gravitational influence.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Was that a quake, or just a stone rolling slowly down the hill?

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The solid structure of the mountains makes here a stable and clear place to observe seismic waves from.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = No movements associated with mountain-building. Ike must be long dead and these mountains must be ancient.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Even the seismic scan seems to like Ike.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Faint seismic waves from tidal deformation and impacts hint at a complex internal structure.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Did you feel that little jolt? Because the seismometer certainly did.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The amplified rumbles from deep inside the moon sound like the growling of a large animal.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The thick layers of loose rubble on the surface muffle and distort seismic waves, making it difficult to pick them up.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = A few faint vibrations are detected, generated by impact events at lower latitudes. None come from the polar regions.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The quakes appear to be coming at regular intervals. A check of your star chart confirms they match the periapsis and apoapsis of the moon's orbit.
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = As Duna gets bigger in the sky, so does the rate of seismic activity. You half expect to see a rock wave rolling towards you.
