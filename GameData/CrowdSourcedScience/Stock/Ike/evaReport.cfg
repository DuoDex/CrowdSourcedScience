        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = You skip along, each step leaving a small cloud of black, carboniferous dust.
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = You look around and marvel at the massive scale of this bowl in the landscape.

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = You really want to leave some footsteps, but the low gravity means making a deep imprint isn't easy.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Everything is grey. You're not sure if it really is grey or if you're slowly losing your colour vision.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = These mountains stretch right from the north pole to the south. Perfect for a long-distance Ike hike.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The soil clings to your boots, and you lift up big clumps of it attached to your sole with every step.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = From your vantage point, all you can see is massive massifs as far as the horion goes.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = You feel on top of the world. Or at least as far as Ike can count as a "world".

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = You think you're looking at the ground, but you're looking at the sky instead and trip over a stone.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The regolith here is looser, and even in the low gravity you leave sizeable footprints.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = This grey dust sticks to everything, and soon you're caked in it head to toe.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = You contemplate climbing one of the mountains when you realise it would be much easier in the low gravity.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The low sun angle at these latitudes illuminates the minute quantities of dust around Ike.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = You stop to shake the clumps of dust off your boot. This stuff really sticks!

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = It seems like a hike would be nice. What might you see from the other side of this moon? Pack plenty of air!
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = Duna hangs in the sky overhead. You think back to the Mun landings, then realise looking at it has made you lose your balance.

        IkeInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = You squint into some binoculars placed on your suit visor and watch the shadows move across the surface of the depression.

        IkeInSpaceLowMidlands = Description: "It's the grey bit between the lighter grey bit and the black bit". Hopefully that's enough.

        IkeInSpaceLowEasternMountainRidge = From space, you can see just how far the mountains extend. Crazy stuff.

        IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = You almost feel as though you can reach out and touch the huge line of mountains below.
        IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = You christen one of the mountains you can see "Kerman Massif". Mission Control doesn't seem to like it much.

        IkeInSpaceLowLowlands = You look down, and see a big, barren, black bowl bordered by bluffs.

        IkeInSpaceLowSouthEasternMountainRange = The mountains are grey and crinkled from space, as though Ike needs some skin cream.

        IkeInSpaceLowSouthPole = You long to build a snowman (dustman?) out of the huge amounts of clumpy dust down below.
        IkeInSpaceLowSouthPole = Craters far below cast long shadows over their basin floors.

        IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
        IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = That red ball is always on the edge of your vision, reminding you that you'd much rather be down there than up here.

        IkeInSpaceHigh = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life could... "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
        IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike is the iris to Duna's red eye. Huh. Never thought of that one before.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = Magnificent desolation indeed. Even Ike's greyscale surface looks nicer from up here.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = It's hard to tell if Ike is moving across the face of Duna, or if it's just your orbit. Probably the latter.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike is no lump of rock. Ike is pretty. You like Ike.
