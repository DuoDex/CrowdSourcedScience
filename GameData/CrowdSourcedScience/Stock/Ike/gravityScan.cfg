        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Gravity scans hint at crustal deformation akin to that of a large impact crater.
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = It's peaceful on the gravity front up here, with Midlands on all sides and few large nearby mountains.

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Nothing out of the ordinary here. Even Duna's influence is dulled.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The lines on the graph draw a smiley face. Even Ike likes you back.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The gravitational anomaly generated by the mountain chain is clearly visible on the scanner.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The centre of gravity here is noticeably different from Ike's geometric centre.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = You'd say you can feel the higher gravity here, but that would be silly. The gravimeter does, though.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The roots of the massive mountains don't have a distinct signature, suggesting Ike is solid for a long way down.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Gravity is very slightly lower here, but almost imperceptably so and only on the instrumentation.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Very little influence from the surrounding mountains is detected. Perhaps they all balance each other out?

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The dust is attracted to electric charge, and currently it's all over the gravimeter.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The line waves lazily across the display. Everything seems to run slower on Ike, as though the low gravity is slowing time.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The gravimeter clicks as it analyses the effects of the electrostatic nature of the dust on gravioli particles.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = Mission Control tells you to stop bashing the sensor to make it run faster.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The gravity strength varies slightly with time, suggesting Ike is is an elliptical orbit.
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = Duna's gravitational influence is strong here. With these tidal forces, it's little wonder Ike and Duna are mutually locked.

        IkeInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Gravity dips slightly as you pass over the depression, but the change is marginal.

        IkeInSpaceLowMidlands = Where the Midlands begin and end is hard to pick out from the quiescence of the Lowlands and strength of the mountain chains.

        IkeInSpaceLowEasternMountainRidge = The needle jumps rapidly as you pass over he hulking mountains below, before returning to normal.

        IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = Now THAT is a gravity anomaly and a half. You start to worry about your orbital altitude.
        IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = The huge mountain range below leaves a very clear signature on the chart.

        IkeInSpaceLowLowlands = Looks pretty featureless. No significant gravitational anomalies detected.

        IkeInSpaceLowSouthEasternMountainRange = The mountains have a clear gravimetric signature, distinct from all the other features around them.

        IkeInSpaceLowSouthPole = Many craters are invisible in the long shadows, so the gravimetry readout helps locate them.

        IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = That's a big bump, and that can only mean one thing - a big mountain (or many mountains)!

        IkeInSpaceHighPolarLowlands = The sensor is registering the influence of the nearby Eastern Mountain Ridge on top of the other signals, but it's tenuous.

        IkeInSpaceHighMidlands = Why does every Midlands biome have to have gravity this constant and boring?

        IkeInSpaceHighEasternMountainRidge = The gravitational influence of the ridge below is fuzzy but visible even this high up.

        IkeInSpaceHighWesternMountainRidge = The beeping of the device startles you, and the reading startles you even more.
        IkeInSpaceHighWesternMountainRidge = The gravimeter notices the mountains before you do. And some mountains they are!

        IkeInSpaceHighLowlands = Any signatures from the Lowlands merge into the noise from the surrounding ridges and plateaus.

        IkeInSpaceHighSouthEasternMountainRange = According to the "Gravimetric Signature Identification Guide Volume XII", that reading means "mountain".

        IkeInSpaceHighSouthPole = Large amounts of piled regolith are visible in the data, even from this great height.

        IkeInSpaceHighCentralMountainRange = Pointing the detector towards the north and south gives you high readings, towards the east or west they drop. Hrm.
