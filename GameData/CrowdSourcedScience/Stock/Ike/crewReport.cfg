        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Well, we're down in the big black bowl, the big black bowl...
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The high walls of the polar depression throw long shadows over the already-dark ground outside.

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = You ask Mission Control what you're doing here.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = You're not so sure you like Ike any more.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Every moon has two sides, and you feel like you landed on the right one.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Even here, Duna is still peeking above the horizon to watch you.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = That bit of ground looks wobbly. Maybe the Lowlands would have been a more stable place to land?
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = You're itching to get out of the capsule and jump around on the mountain.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = You see a green blur outside, and hope it isn't the kraken.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is dark, and the sky is dark. Did we actually land?

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = More grey mountains. How exciting.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = These mountains are big. You look out and see them rising to the stars around you.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = You plant your foot on a smooth patch on the floor and almost slide over. You thank Ike's low gravity.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = By now, you're starting to think the grey of the surface has leached the colour from your vision. You hope you don't turn grey yourself.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = You could sit in here forever, watching the dust storms roll across the Dunaian surface far away through the thickened glass.
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = You crane your neck against the window, trying to get a glimpse of Duna.

        IkeInSpaceLow = Ike looks dark and foreboding. Can we go to Duna instead?
        IkeInSpaceLow = Some of those mountains reach up pretty darn high. You make sure to check the altimeter.

        IkeInSpaceHigh = You ask Mission Control if they, too, like Ike.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = There's Ike, though the thick glass of the capsule window. You're not sure if you like it.
