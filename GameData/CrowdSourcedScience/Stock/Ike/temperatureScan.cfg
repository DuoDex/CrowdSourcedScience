        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Sunlight here is limited, so it's cold enough to freeze water even in a vacuum.
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Kerbol rarely reaches above the precipices and crags surrounding the depression, making it perpetually cold.

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Even in direct sunlight, it's still fairly chilly.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Seems pretty average as far as bodies around Duna's distance go.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Temperatures range from below freezing during the day to halfway to absolute zero at nights.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = Being high up doesn't seem to affect the temperature much in the absence of an atmosphere.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The high albedo of the light grey dust reflects a lot of heat off the surface.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = It's about as cold as you expect it to be at Duna's distance, and altitude (unsurprisingly) doesn't affect it at all.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The dark surface absorbs heat during the day and re-emits it at night for a bit more warmth.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder how much the surface would warm by if exposed to oxygen and a spark.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Where's the thermometer? It's got enough dust on to blend into the grey rock.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The higher albedo of the lighter highlands makes the rocks, and you, colder.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The sun's just as warm as it can be at Duna distance, but the ground is freezing cold.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The reading makes you realise you're cold. You decide to go and have some hot koffee.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The weak thermal back radiation from Duna brings noticeable warmth during nights.
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The temperature plunges whenever Duna eclipses the sun. Bad Duna!

        IkeInSpaceLow = Temperature readings are nominal for this distance from Kerbol - that is, to say, cold.
        IkeInSpaceLow = Ike's low albedo means it radiates a lot of heat at night.

        IkeInSpaceHigh = You tell yourself that this definitely isn't cold. You'll have to face even colder bodies later.
        IkeInSpaceHigh = Picking up some heat radiating off Duna. Fancy that, Duna warming something up!
