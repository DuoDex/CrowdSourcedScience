    {
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Soil samples you take suggest a moderate water content.
        IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = It's black and grainy...what's that in there? A small, transparent crystal? Looks like ice!

        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = You find a green mineral in the soil.
        IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The dusty ground here has neither the stickiness of the highlands nor the darkness of the lowlands.

        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = You collect some sand, which glimmers in all shades of grey.
        IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The regolith here seems very sticky, and clings to the side of the test box.

        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = You're too busy rubbernecking to notice that patch of loose regolith, and almost lose your footing while you absent-mindledly scoop up some dust.
        IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = A rock jutting out of the dust makes for a rare sample of non-regolith bedrock as you chip at it with a hammer.

        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The surface sample is one of the darkest colored things you have ever encountered in your life. You put it in the bottom of the sample container and try to forget how much it scared you.
        IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands soil is dark and loose. As a joke you put some in your pipe and smoke it - it caught fire and you now have to explain to Mission Control why the fire alarm went off.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The white soil is distributed in layers several millimeters thick and seems to be a product of the impact events.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The regolith in the mountains in this area seems to have less carbon than the darker lowland material.

        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = You take several rock samples. They indicate a higher-than-average silica content.
        IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The sample doesn't want to go into the container, and sticks to it. You give it a solid bashing until it does.

        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = It's a piece of Ike. You like Ike. Everyone likes Ike. You will bring it back to Kerbin!
        IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = You're too distracted by lobbing rocks at Duna to remember to put one in the box.
