    {
        EelooSrfLanded* = There's a slight quake every now and then, but not much noteworthy activity.
        EelooSrfLanded* = There's not much seismic activity out here.
        EelooSrfLanded* = Some seismic activity suggests that the interior of Eeloo is not completely frozen.

        EelooSrfLandedPoles* = Darn it, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a geologist! How do I know if there's going to be an Eeloo quake?

        EelooSrfLandedNorthernGlaciers* = Eeloo is silent.

        EelooSrfLandedLowlands* = Vibrations suggest that the surface of Eeloo is in fact moving over a liquid core.

        EelooSrfLandedHighlands* = Was that a small tremor, or did the planet just shiver?

        EelooSrfLandedIceCanyons* = The scans indicate that the ice below you is moving slightly.

        EelooSrfLandedCraters* = The planet seems as still and dead as a rock right now. A large, frozen, ice-covered rock.

        EelooSrfLandedMidlands* = The ice and rock appear to be shifting slightly, indicating some internal heating.
