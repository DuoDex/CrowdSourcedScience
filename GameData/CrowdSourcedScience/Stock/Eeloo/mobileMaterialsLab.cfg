        EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.

        //EelooSrfLandedPoles =

        EelooSrfLandedNorthernGlaciers = You look away, and some of the materials shape into a dog.

        EelooSrfLandedLowlands = All of the materials have frozen solid, except for one which has mysteriously caught fire.

        EelooSrfLandedHighlands = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.

        EelooSrfLandedIceCanyons = A strange green crystal has grown. Maybe Mission Control will know what to do with it.

        EelooSrfLandedCraters = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.

        EelooSrfLandedMidlands = Most of the materials are frozen solid.

        //EelooSrfLandedFragipan =
        //EelooSrfLandedBabbagePatch =
        //EelooSrfLandedSouthernGlaciers =
        //EelooSrfLandedMuGlacier =

        EelooInSpaceLow = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.

        EelooInSpaceHigh = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.
