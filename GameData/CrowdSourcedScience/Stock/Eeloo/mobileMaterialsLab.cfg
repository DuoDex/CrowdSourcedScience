        EelooSrfLanded* = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.

        //EelooSrfLandedPoles* =

        EelooSrfLandedNorthernGlaciers* = You look away, and some of the materials shape into a dog.

        EelooSrfLandedLowlands* = All of the materials have frozen solid, except for one which has mysteriously caught fire.

        EelooSrfLandedHighlands* = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.

        EelooSrfLandedIceCanyons* = A strange green crystal has grown. Maybe Mission Control will know what to do with it.

        EelooSrfLandedCraters* = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.

        EelooSrfLandedMidlands* = Most of the materials are frozen solid.

        //EelooSrfLandedFragipan* =
        //EelooSrfLandedBabbagePatch* =
        //EelooSrfLandedSouthernGlaciers* =
        //EelooSrfLandedMuGlacier* =

        EelooInSpaceLow* = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.

        EelooInSpaceHigh* = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.
