    %RESULTS
    {
        EveSrfLandedPoles = It's very quiet up here. No local seismicity to be found.
        EveSrfLandedPoles = Bored with the lack of results, you try to turn the seismometer into a makeshift heart monitor, only to realise how stressed you actually are.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = A strange echoing effect is apparent. It could be a sign of underground cavities buried deep beneath the surface.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = It sure is a mess down there, judging from the very confusing reponse to pings.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The shifting currents below the surface induce very faint vibrations in the rock.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The seismometer registers the creaks of the vessel as seismic events.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The device spits out an impressive array of sparks, but no data.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The scan yields a great deal of important information, but none of it says "purple".
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = Mission Control tells you to put the boom box away so the readout doesn't consist of your jammin' beats.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Very little activity is detected. The tectonic processes that formed the mountains must have long since ceased.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Some of those mountainsides look unstable. You hope an earthquake doesn't make them collapse while you're here.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Distorted seismic waves passing up through the rock outline the crater's breccia lens and shatter cones.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The scientists back at KSP would give their right hand to have been able to record the impact event on a seismograph.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = The large circular lake causes seismic waves to reverberate and echo around the sea.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = Waves slapping on the shore produce regular tiny pulses of movement.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = Whatever seismic waves may be found lower down, up here they're very muffled by the great bulk of the mountain.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = A number of skittering rocks on the steep slopes produce a swarm of noisy signatures.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = A small number of shallow, genuine earthquakes are found to be coming from the seafloor.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = The scan hints at the internal structure of Eve's crust.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = As with any highly sensitive piece of scienctific equipment, the seismometer doesn't look like it will last much longer.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = Can you use the seismometer to detect sea monsters bumping around in the ocean?
