        EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird color.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.

        //EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea =

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.

        //EveSrfLandedCraterLake =
        //EveSrfLandedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedOlympus =
        //EveSrfLandedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedCraters =
        //EveSrfLandedFoothills =
        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveFlyingLow = It's thick, purple, and full of hot air. What did you expect?

        EveFlyingLowPoles = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.

        //EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea =

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?

        //EveFlyingLowCraterLake =
        //EveFlyingLowWesternSea =
        //EveFlyingLowOlympus =
        //EveFlyingLowEasternSea =
        //EveFlyingLowCraters =
        //EveFlyingLowFoothills =
        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake =
        //EveFlyingLowShallows =

        EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of super-heated water vapor.

        //EveFlyingHighPoles =

        EveFlyingHighMidlands = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.

        //EveFlyingHighExplodiumSea =

        EveFlyingHighLowlands = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.

        EveFlyingHighHighlands = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulfur dioxide. Mission Control insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.

        EveFlyingHighPeaks = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor.

        EveFlyingHighImpactEjecta = The highly corrosive gasses start pocking and stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.

        //EveFlyingHighCraterLake =
        //EveFlyingHighWesternSea =
        //EveFlyingHighOlympus =
        //EveFlyingHighEasternSea =
        //EveFlyingHighCraters =
        //EveFlyingHighFoothills =
