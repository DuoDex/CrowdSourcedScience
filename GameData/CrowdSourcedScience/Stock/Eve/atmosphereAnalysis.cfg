    %RESULTS
    {
        EveSrfLandedPoles = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.
        EveSrfLandedPoles = The thick, cloying air is still just as oppressive vs everything at the poles.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird color.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The air is so thick the analyser has to push it into the chamber with a stick on a robo-arm.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Lots of carbon dioxide, and even more down here at low altitude.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = Whether high or low; there are no traces of grape, aubergine or royalty to be found.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Did the eggs in the drawer go off again? That's a lot of sulphur out there.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Normally the air up so high might be refreshing, though on Eve it's anything but.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = You wonder if your tanks of oxygen could oxygenate the atmosphere here.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
        EveErfLandedImpactEjecta = A lazy air current slowly lifts a small amount of surface dust into the air, and the mixture gains "1% purple rock".

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = You ask KSC to move whichever technician contaminated the sensor with paint scrubber to the experimental rocket testing program.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = Traces of Ar, He and Ne are detected in the noxious gas mix.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = On the top of the world, you're still not up high enough for the gases to separate yet.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = Still just as nasty as ever. Why can't these mountains be tall enough to get into the good bits?

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The sea air is very bracing, or at least it would be if it wasn't lethal.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters =

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = Why do they call these foothills? The air doesn't contain a cheesy smell at least.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = The designation of foothills seems like a mostly academic term, because the gas mix conforms perfectly to the Eve standard.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =

        EveSrfLandedShallows = Some of the mysterious chemicals that comprise explodium drift through the air near the coast.

        EveFlyingLowPoles = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.
        EveFlyingLowPoles = No ice in the air up here. Come to think of it, you haven't detected a single water molecule at all so far.

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
        EveFlyingLowMidlands = It's dense, purple, and full of hot air. What did you expect?

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = That's clearly not water, since there's no trace of it in the air.

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?

        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = The composition of this "explodium" must be highly dense, since whatever it is doesn't leave the surface.

        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = Still no trace of what gives the planet its purple colour. You hope whatever it is isn't infectious, since you're seeing a lot of purple yourself.

        EveFlyingLowOlympus = A few minute traces of elements made by interactions between the atmosphere and the solar wind trickle down through the clouds.

        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.

        //EveFlyingLowCraters =

        EveFlyingLowFoothills = The trace acidic compounds in the air eat away worryingly at the sensitive equipment.

        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake =

        EveFlyingLowShallows = The monitor flickers as the heat, pressure and acidity take their toll on the analyser. Fortunately, it remains operational.

        EveFlyingHighPoles = Faint traces of ionised gases associated with aurorae are detected.

        EveFlyingHighMidlands = Heavy gases in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.

        EveFlyingHighExplodiumSea = The sensor is detecting a cloud of super-heated water vapor. Fascinating, considering there is none lower down at all.

        EveFlyingHighLowlands = You eagerly stare at the readout but, sadly, it displays a list of deadly gases and not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.

        EveFlyingHighHighlands = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulfur dioxide. Mission Control insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.

        EveFlyingHighPeaks = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor as well as your senses.

        EveFlyingHighImpactEjecta = The highly corrosive gases start pocking and stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.

        EveFlyingHighCraterLake = Up at the top of the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide gradually gives way to nitrogen.

        EveFlyingHighWesternSea = Ethereal wisps of purple clouds flow past the craft, but the analyser doesn't register them.

        EveFlyingHighOlympus = A cocktail of strange molecules are being detected as complex compounds are constantly formed and broken apart in the upper atmosphere.

        EveFlyingHighEasternSea = Preliminary results from up high are not encouraging. You're not so enthusiastic about going to Eve's surface now.

        //EveFlyingHighCraters =

        EveFlyingHighFoothills = Eve's atmosphere isn't actually grape juice? What is this kowmulch!? Looks like we brought the empty bottles for nothing.

        //EveFlyingHighAkatsukiLake =

        EveFlyingHighShallows = One upshot of Eve's atmosphere being so thick is that the analyser has plenty to work with, even all the way up here. We don't actually have to go downstairs to know how nasty it is.
