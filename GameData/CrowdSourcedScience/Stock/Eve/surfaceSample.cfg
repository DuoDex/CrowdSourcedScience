        EveSrfLanded = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.
        EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
        EveSrfLanded = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
        EveSrfLanded = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.
        EveSrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.
        EveSrfLanded = I've come all this way for THIS?
        EveSrfLanded = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 Kerbals.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = Oooooo. Purple!

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it worth it? Sure! It's purple!
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this color falls as precipitation.
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = You analyze the sample that turns out to be an amethyst.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The surface sample reveals a lot of interesting chemical compounds. They suggest that much of the body that hit Eve burned up before reaching the planet's surface.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The soil seems to be significantly heavier here.

        //EveSrfLandedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedOlympus =
        //EveSrfLandedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedCraters =
        //EveSrfLandedFoothills =
        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveSrfSplashed = The purple water dyes the suit pink.
        EveSrfSplashed = Further analysis will determine if this liquid is indeed grape-flavored, as you hope it is.
        EveSrfSplashed = Johnny was a chemist's son, but Johnny is no more; What Johnny thought was H2O, was H2SO4.
        EveSrfSplashed = You try tasting your sample, and find that it is indeed not grape soda.
        EveSrfSplashed = This purplish liquid sample looks like your favorite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.
        EveSrfSplashed = You find traces of liquid blutonium.
        EveSrfSplashed = This liquid looks an awful lot like mercury now that you've collected it in a bottle. You hope your suit is as waterproof as the manual promised.
        EveSrfSplashed = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin's core.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = This isn't water, it is sulfur dioxide.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = You find traces of liquid blutonium.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = This looks very very dangerous.
