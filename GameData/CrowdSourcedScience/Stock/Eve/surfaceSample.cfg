        EveSrfLandedPoles = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?
        EveSrfLandedPoles = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = Oooooo. Purple!

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it worth it? Sure! It's purple!
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The soil seems to be significantly heavier here.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this color falls as precipitation.
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = You analyze the sample that turns out to be an amethyst.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The highlands regolith is loose and gravelly, and some stones are stained more purple than others.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The surface sample reveals a lot of interesting chemical compounds. They suggest that much of the body that hit Eve burned up before reaching the planet's surface.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = The rock you pick off the ground seems to possess unnatural power.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = The stone feels very warm in your hands as you turn it over and examine it.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = You've come all this way for THIS?

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 Kerbals.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = The sample seems to be contaminated with explodium, since it acts like an eraser.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = Whatever substance the liquid is looks very, very dangerous.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The surface sample just says "Something evil".
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The pH of this liquid is "Out of measurement range".

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = This purplish liquid sample looks like your favorite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = You try tasting your sample, and find that it is indeed not grape soda or anything that should come within a mile of any living thing.

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = This liquid looks an awful lot like mercury now that you've collected it in a bottle. You hope your suit is as waterproof as the manual promised.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = You find traces of liquid blutonium.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = Johnny was a chemist's son, but Johnny is no more; What Johnny thought was H2O, was H2SO4.
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = Further analysis will determine if this liquid is indeed grape-flavored, as you hope it is.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin's core.
        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The purple water dyes the suit pink.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = This isn't water, it is sulfur dioxide.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = The dense liquid is difficult to push the sample container into thanks to buoyancy.
        EveSrfSplashedShallows = The toxic mixture known as explodium should be toxic to all life, but you can't shake the feeling something is watching you under the surface.
