        EveSrfLanded = The sensor's overload warning is on. It appears Eve's gravity is almost too much.

        //EveSrfLandedPoles =
        //EveSrfLandedMidlands =

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = Just looking at the readout makes you feel heavier.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The gravity here makes you feel really fat, while at the same time, you look quite skinny.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity of Eve strongly supports your personal "Planet Core is a Black Hole" theory.

        EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = So heavy... its weight level must be over 9000!
