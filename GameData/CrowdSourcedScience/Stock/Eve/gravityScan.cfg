        EveSrfLandedPoles* = The sensor's overload warning is on. It appears Eve's gravity is almost too much.
        EveSrfLandedPoles* = "Warranty void if exposed to more than 0g". Better not break it then.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands* = Kerbals are short enough already in 1g, so you wonder how short a 1.7g heavyworlder would be.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands* = The gravimeter mounting bracket bends alarmingly under the force.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea* = You feel glad there are no tides. Just the presence of the liquid in that sea is bad enough, and that's without it chasing after you.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands* = The gravity here makes you feel really fat, while at the same time, you look quite skinny.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands* = Together with the thick atmosphere, this gravity will seriously hamper efforts to take off.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands* = The gravity of Eve strongly supports your personal "Planet Core is a Black Hole" theory.
        EveSrfLandedHighlands* = You knew it! You didn't put on weight, Eve put the weight on you!

        EveSrfLandedPeaks* = Given the wealth of data to go on, the gravimeter finishes its scan in record time.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks* = Comparison to the Eve average and expected values allows the determining of the mountains' missing mass anomaly.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta* = The very high gravity of Eve means the meteorite that struck here must have done so with great speed.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta* = You wait for the gravelly ejecta to stop shifting under the ship before measuring the gravity.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake* = Holy gravioli, that's a lot of them!

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea* = Something about the gravity of the sea is seriously off, but you can't put your finger on it.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus* = The free-air gravity anomaly is enormous. The roots on these mountains must be like a huge geological tree trunk.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus* = The position from the top of the world gives detailed insight into Eve's crustal structure.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea* = Just looking at the readout makes you feel heavier.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters* = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills* = Nothing out of the Eve ordinary, aside from some pull from the nearby "adult" mountains.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills* = The weight presses down on the gravimeter. You could swear it likes it.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake* = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows* = So heavy... its weight level must be over 9000!

        EveInSpaceLowPoles* = Gravity ticks up and down as you pass over the varied polar surface.

        EveInSpaceLowMidlands* = Graviolis swirl around as they go up and down, in and out of Eve.
        EveInSpaceLowMidlands* = Small nicks in gravity betray the presence of many buried, eroded and long forgotten craters from Eve's ancient past.

        EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea* = Sudden spikes and dips in gravity reveal prominent continental shelves deep under the surface of the seas.
        EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea* = Eve has no major moon, so the oceans do not experience tides.

        EveInSpaceLowLowlands* = Super gravity versus super atmosphere. What would win?
        EveInSpaceLowLowlands* = With the reading complete, you're one step closer to working out why the gravity is so darn high.

        EveInSpaceLowHighlands* = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.
        EveInSpaceLowHighlands* = Now close to Eve, the equipment gets its first tastes of the punishing Eve gravity.

        EveInSpaceLowPeaks* = Gravimetric data from the peaks is analysed from multiple angles to generate a subsurface map of the mountains.
        EveInSpaceLowPeaks* = The numerous mountain peaks each have a distinct gravitational signature.

        EveInSpaceLowImpactEjecta* = The lip of the craters provides a distinctive shape to the gravity line.
        EveInSpaceLowImpactEjecta* = You hope the high gravity doesn't cause you to suffer the same fate as the impactor.

        EveInSpaceLowCraterLake* = The normal gravimetric traces of an impact basin are faint and truncated. Something deep down must be removing them.
        EveInSpaceLowCraterLake* = That's a big hole. The gravimeter concurs.

        EveInSpaceLowWesternSea* = Unexpectedly, the Western Sea shows strong gravimetric signs associated with major continental rift basins.

        EveInSpaceLowOlympus* = The signals of the huge mountains dwarf all those around them.
        EveInSpaceLowOlympus* = The regional gravitational anomaly suggests the mountain roots extend down dozens of miles into Eve's mantle.

        EveInSpaceLowEasternSea* = The floor of the basin seems to have very little underwater topography aside from a handful of islands.

        //EveInSpaceLowCraters* = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceLowFoothills* = The gravity looks uncomfortably high. You'd rather stay up here, thanks.
        EveInSpaceLowFoothills* = The proximity of large nearby peaks and craters makes it difficult to isolate the signatures of the individual landforms.

        //EveInSpaceLowAkatsukiLake* = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceLowShallows* = The shallower portions of the oceans don't have a lot going for them gravimetrically.
        EveInSpaceLowShallows* = You hope the liquid down there is dense so you don't sink into it. Someone tells you buoyancy doesn't work like that.

        EveInSpaceHighPoles* = The varied polar landscape outputs a highly interesting and colourful gravimetric map.

        EveInSpaceHighMidlands* = Zzzzz. Wake me up when something interesting comes up.

        EveInSpaceHighExplodiumSea* = The sensor spikes every time you orbit over the ocean.

        EveInSpaceHighLowlands* = The transition between land and sea is softened at this high altitude.

        EveInSpaceHighHighlands* = You don't understand how Eve can keep its rotational axis straight with all this lopsided mass.

        EveInSpaceHighPeaks* = The sensor says it found something, and beeps insistently at you.

        EveInSpaceHighImpactEjecta* = You dial up the sensitivity on the equipment to get a good scan of the crater.

        EveInSpaceHighCraterLake* = The signature of the massive crater is muted more than it should be from high altitude.

        EveInSpaceHighWesternSea* = Tantalising hints of a major positive gravitational anomaly start to appear.

        EveInSpaceHighOlympus* = Every needle swings to point at the huge rocky edifice on the distant surface.

        EveInSpaceHighEasternSea* = The gravimeter stops working. KSC tells you to switch it off and on again.

        //EveInSpaceHighCraters* = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceHighFoothills* = A piece of ship hull drifts past the sensor and registers on the super-sensitive equipment. Fascinating!

        //EveInSpaceHighAkatsukiLake* = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceHighShallows* = You wonder if you could use the gravimeter to try and scan for creatures under the purple waves.
