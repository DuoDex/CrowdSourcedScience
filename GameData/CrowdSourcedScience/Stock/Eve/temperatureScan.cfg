        EveSrfLandedPoles = It's slightly cooler, but still far too hot for anything to live.
	EveSrfLandedPoles = If the temperature could be cooled by sixty degrees, this might be a nice place. Ignoring the crushing atmosphere, toxic water and suspect chemicals in the dirt, that is.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = There's nothing middling about these burning temperatures at all.
	EveSrfLandedMidlands = The ship bakes in the heat as the air around it shimmers with mirages.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The liquid in the thermometer seems to be frothing angrily.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Readings are off the charts, literally. Engineers in Mission Control hastily append another sheet of printer paper to them.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature is so hot that the thermometer wants to slap you in the face.
	EveSrfLandedHighlands = Eve's proximity to Kerbol makes any kerbiforming effort doomed to failure as the planet is constantly blasted by heat.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Perhaps that mountain over there is slightly cooler?
	EveSrfLandedPeaks = A gentle wind blows up. Somehow it makes the air even hotter.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = That's far too pleasant to be right. Maybe if you jiggle the cord... aha! There it goes.
	EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Blackbody radiation from the ground and the hot air means it's still extremely hot in shadow.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = You consider dunking the thermometer in the lake to cool it off.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = A weak sea breeze does little to alleviate the oppressive, cloying heat.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = You're not sure whether you want to go any higher, lest you be burned by the sun as well as everything else.
	EveSrfLandedOlympus = The temperature isn't as ludicrous all the way up here, but you're still not going outside without some ice packs.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = You start to worry that the liquid in the thermometer might boil soon.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [Biome doesn't exist]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = You're not sure if the temperature reading is accurate or if the gravity is so strong the mercury can't rise properly.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [Biome doesn't exist]

	EveSrfLandedShallows = Sun, sea and sand are all here, and the temperature is lovely and warm to boot.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = "Goooood morning ladies and gentlekerbs, it's going to be a real scorcher out at sea today, with surface highs of over a hundred and fifty degrees expected and sunny weather all day. Better take plenty of water with you when you go out, and dip to cool off. This is Jeb, for KSWN."
	EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = The sea is warm enough that any bathing in it is strongly discouraged.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = The crater walls radiate heat down onto the sea like a planetary solar oven.

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = The data suggests a suitable temperature for frying kalamari.
	EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = Despite the lack of not-water interchange, the temperature in this basin sea is the same as the rest.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = The grape soda is hot enough that you recommend leaving it in the fridge for a while before drinking it.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.
	EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = You should have brought a fishing rod, since anything you caught would be ready-cooked.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A, biome doesn't exist]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [Biome doesn't exist]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = The labels on the thermometer have dissolved, but the reading is all the way at the top anyway.
	EveSrfSplashedShallows = Quite how this ocean doesn't boil is lost on you, since it's well above the boiling point of.....what was the ocean made of again?

        EveFlyingLowPoles = Temperatures are almost tolerable. For some people, that is. Ok, nobody.

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = When life gives you lemons, send them to Eve. The heat will show those lemons who's boss.

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = The shiny, flat ocean surface reflects heat back into the sky, and straight at you.

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = The greenhouse effect is extremely powerful on Eve, as though it was subject to a runaway warming. 

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The thermometer has turned into a miniature lava lamp.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = Even above the highest mountains, it's still baking hot.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = In this heat, you could just hold your koffee outside the ship to keep it piping hot.

        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = If these aerial readings are anything to go by, dipping your toe in the sea would leave it charcoaled as well as dissolved and crushed.

        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = A wire comes loose on the thermometer, causing it to erroneously read the temperature as something nice.

        EveFlyingLowOlympus = You hope whatever part is stopping you from slamming into the mountainside doesn't melt in these temperatures.

        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = The temperature is a balmy purple.

        //EveFlyingLowCraters = [Biome doesn't exist]

        EveFlyingLowFoothills = Sluggish air currents carry heat up from the hotplate surface.

        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake = [Biome doesn't exist]

        EveFlyingLowShallows = I tell you what is shallow, and that's the atmosphere temperature gradient.

        EveFlyingHigh = You're nowhere near the ground, and it's warm already.
	EveFlyingHigh = KSC assures you it's nice and cool down there. You, and the thermometer, beg to differ.
	EveFlyingHigh = The red alcohol in the thermometer is turning purple.

        EveInSpaceLow = You detect a definite heat signature from the planet below.
	EveInSpaceLow = The planet and the atmosphere radiate heat into space.
	EveInSpaceLow = The thermometer outputs a significantly higher reading if rotated to face the planet.

        EveInSpaceHigh = The thick atmosphere acts like a mirror for heat, causing Eve to shine bright with infrared radiation.
	EveInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's rays are more powerful at this distance. It'll be hot down there.
	EveInSpaceHigh = Just looking at Eve makes you want to turn the thermostat down a notch.
