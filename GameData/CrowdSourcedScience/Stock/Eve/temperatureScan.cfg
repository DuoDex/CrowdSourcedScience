        EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if the temperature reading is accurate or if the gravity is so strong the mercury can't rise properly...

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = Readings are off the charts, literally. Engineers in Mission Control hastily append another sheet of printer paper to them.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The liquid in the thermometer seems to be frothing angrily.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature is so hot that the thermometer wants to slap you in the face.

        //EveSrfLandedPeaks =

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = That's far too pleasant to be right. Maybe if you jiggle the cord... aha! There it goes.

        EveSrfSplashed = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.
        EveSrfSplashed = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.
        EveSrfSplashed = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The data suggests a suitable temperature for frying kalamari.
