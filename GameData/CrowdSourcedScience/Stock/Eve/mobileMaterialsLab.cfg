        EveSrfLanded = The samples appear torn between their allegiance to green and their new environment of purple. They turn an indecisive shade of blue.

        //EveSrfLandedPoles =
        //EveSrfLandedMidlands =

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The materials that have not melted are one by one starting to catch fire. This probably has implications for space suit design.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The radioactivity has caused the blutonium samples to vaporize. Apart from that, everything is normal.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The gel samples begin to evaporate, making odd colored smoke. You suddenly wonder if this could be used to make colored exhaust.

        //EveSrfLandedPeaks =

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!

        //EveSrfLandedCraterLake =
        //EveSrfLandedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedOlympus =
        //EveSrfLandedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedCraters =
        //EveSrfLandedFoothills =
        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveSrfSplashed = The oceans seem to be stripping the paint off of the lab's materials safety decals.
        EveSrfSplashed = The materials start to dissolve. The liquid here appears to be acidic.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.

        //EveSrfSplashedLowlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks =
        //EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta =
        //EveSrfSplashedCraterLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus =
        //EveSrfSplashedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfSplashedCraters =
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills =
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedShallows =

        EveFlyingLow = The samples are torn out of the container by the pressure of the atmosphere. Perhaps Kerbtape wasn't enough.

        EveFlyingHigh = Ten out of ten samples agree: "The stuff below you is a liquid."
        EveFlyingHigh = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.

        EveInSpaceLow = All samples turn purple out of fear.

        EveInSpaceHigh = The materials bay, after an apparent deliberation, produces a liquid. It's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
