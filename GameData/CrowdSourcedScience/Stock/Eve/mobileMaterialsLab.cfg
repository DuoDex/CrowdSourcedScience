        EveSrfLandedPoles = It's still warm enough to make a lot of things rather soft or outright liquid.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The gel samples begin to evaporate, making odd colored smoke. You suddenly wonder if this could be used to make colored exhaust.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The materials that have not melted are one by one starting to catch fire. This probably has implications for space suit design.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Some of the canisters are crushed like tin cans from the atmospheric pressure. You try not to imagine the ship meeting the same fate.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The samples appear torn between their allegiance to green and their new environment of purple. They turn an indecisive shade of blue.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Despite the roasting temperatures, it's not enough to set anything on fire given the lack of oxygen. Some materials char, though.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Some of the monitoring equipment has suffered the same melty fate as the samples.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = Most of the paints on the samples have dripped off or turned black.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = A small amount of dust has covered the samples in even more purple shades.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = Some of the samples of organic material remind you of the results from the time your parents forgot to set the oven timer.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The sluggish air movement is slow, but the thick air grants it enough force to blow a couple of samples alarmingly close to the edge.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = A bottle of water explodes from the steam pressure in the heat, blasting the sample bay with shards and superheated water.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = You are extremely disappointed to find the ice cream you packed to relax by the beach with has melted and caught fire.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = The oceans seem to be stripping the paint off of the lab's materials safety decals.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The rubber duck you always keep in the bay as a good luck charm floats around, melting in the boiling liquid.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The materials melt and/or explode. We may want to get out of here.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = The materials start to dissolve. The liquid here appears to be acidic.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = Several objects that should not be floating float out of the bay, bobbing in the toxic sea.

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = Some sparks from a shorting cable give you a miniature heart attack as they dance over the not-water, but nothing explodes.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = Several materials that are quite close to the materials of your ship are readily attacked and destroyed by the fluid.

        EveFlyingLow = The samples are torn out of the container by the pressure of the atmosphere. Perhaps Kerbtape wasn't enough.
        EveFlyingLow = Dribbles of melting polymers trail out of the bay, borne aloft on the thick purple winds.
        EveFlyingLow = Small amounts of airborne purple dust sticks to the rapidly softening materials, dyeing them purple.

        EveFlyingHigh = Ten out of ten samples agree: "The stuff below you is a liquid."
        EveFlyingHigh = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
        EveFlyingHigh = The samples are rattling around in the bay from heavy aerodynamic forces.

        EveInSpaceLow = All samples turn purple out of fear.
        EveInSpaceLow = You could swear the samples are turning purple already, and you're still in space.
        EveInSpaceLow = When you open the bay, there are no samples. You close the doors and reopen them, and they're all there again. Is Gilly playing magic tricks on you?

        EveInSpaceHigh = The materials bay, after an apparent deliberation, produces a liquid. It's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
        EveInSpaceHigh = The radioactivity has caused the blutonium samples to glow even more. Apart from that, everything is normal.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Some of the material do not seem to have survived the journey from Kerbin in the hard vacuum environment.
