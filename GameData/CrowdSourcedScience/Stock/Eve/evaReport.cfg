        EveSrfLandedPoles = Why can't the R&D eggheads invent a suit with movement-assisting servomotors already?
        EveSrfLandedPoles = Poles, schmoles, this the planetary oven all right.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You should have done more exercise back on Kerbin.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = "Welcome to hell, weather's great here. Pull up a chair, have a cold beer....."

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = You decide to take a short walk, but think better of it after the first few steps.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder what jerk put lead weights in your suit.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The toss of a pebble suggests that the atmosphere is REALLY, REALLY thick.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = You feel like you may have put on some weight.
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = "Should I take the left foot or the right foot?" The decision weighs heavy on your shoulders - literally.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!"
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The steep, gravelly ground makes walking up the slope torturously slow as you slide back constantly.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The extreme pressure is making it hard to move. Thankfully, you can still wiggle your toes.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You step on a loose stone and fall hard on your face. That hurts here!

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = That water nearby would be looking quite inviting were it not for the fact that it is almost certainly not water or healthy for you.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = Everything about this place makes you want to get back into the capsule and lie down.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants! Or gods.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = *Huff* Must.... *huff* reach.... *huff* top.... *huff*

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The liquid in the seas has contaminated the soil around here. You know this because your boot has been bleached of colour.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = This planet was certainly not made with kerbals in mind, and vice versa.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = You push some dirt into a small pile with your feet. There, a foothill on a foothill!

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = You've come all this way to Eve's coast, only for your bucket and spade to melt and dissolve instantly.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = You pour some water from a bottle in your pocket onto the surface, and it forms a steaming sheen on top.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = You realize swimming in a spacesuit is harder than you thought. You regret the decision of leaving the ship.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The liquid is stripping the colour off your spacesuit alarmingly quickly.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = The sea is hot. Very hot. You want to get out of it now.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = The crater walls curve out of sight around the ocean you find yourself floating in.

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = You hope dearly that your suit has been properly sealed and corrosion-proofed.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = The extremely dense liquid is hard to get your hands and legs into to swim with.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = You have the idea to use your suit to dive with. You can only just get your head below the surface, and you can't see anything.
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = The "water" is thick and soupy. It drips in large blobs off your hand.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = Whose idea was it to make these helmets so large? You can't even look down.
        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = You had a dream like this once. Unlike the dream, however, this isn't grape soda, and robot dolphins are not swimming in it.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = Mission Control assures you that there are definitely no monsters in the sea.
        EveSrfSplashedShallows = You try and light the explodium on fire, forgetting you're currently swimming in it. Fortunately, there's no oxygen to allow it to ignite.

        EveFlyingLowPoles = If this place is hell, you feel like an infernal Santa Klaus, flying through the hot polar air.
        EveFlyingLowPoles = The temperatures are slightly less burning at these latitudes, and the rushing air makes it slightly cooler still.

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.
        EveFlyingLowMidlands = You'd say it looks boring, but in a place like Eve, nothing is ever boring.

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = You start to think that it's entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere as well as the oceans.
        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = The dense not-water probably wouldn't break your fall if you needed it to. Hopefully you won't.

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn't hurt to taste it... right?
        EveFlyingLowLowlands = Flying in the thickest parts of the atmosphere is hard, with the very air opposing your progress.

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The purple behemoth dares you to slip.
        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The mountains are the surface's way of spitting defiance in the face of the crushing atmosphere and gravity. Be more mountain.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = "I will not give up, I will not give in! I will land boots down, I will stand again."
        EveFlyingLowPeaks = Spiky peaks rise from the surface, as if trying to snag you in midair.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = "Nuts."
        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = The miles of impact debris must only for a small part of the crater.

        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = The thick atmosphere makes it difficult to move around. You swear that if not for the high gravity, you could hover a bit just by flapping your arms.
        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = You wonder how far down the shimmering liquid filling the impact basin goes.

        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = You're more concerned with the climate control warning light that just appeared.
        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = You would rather not end up in the drink, thank you very much.

        EveFlyingLowOlympus = You're not sure you needed to be flying for this. You could just have climbed a bit higher up the mountain.
        EveFlyingLowOlympus = The view from the ground was amazing and this one's even better.

        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = What's that floating down there? It better not be piece of the ship.
        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = When you were sent to Eve, you didn't anticipate trying not to tumble through the air over a toxic ocean

        //EveFlyingLowCraters = [N/A]

        EveFlyingLowFoothills = You feel like your helmet is dissolving. Oh wait... IT IS! Get me back in, now!
        EveFlyingLowFoothills = The suit starts to feel awful warm. You crank the suit thermostat down another notch.

        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveFlyingLowShallows = The set of tools you had clipped to your belt fall off and plummet out of sight.
        EveFlyingLowShallows = You're not sure if you're near or far from the ocean surface. All the purple is playing havoc with your depth perception.

        EveFlyingHigh = You deliberate whether you'd rather fall on the ground or into that nasty liquid.
        EveFlyingHigh = Even all the way up here the atmosphere still buffets you around.
        EveFlyingHigh = You know how dangerous Eve atmospheric entry is, and wish to lodge a formal objection to this highly dangerous course of action.

        EveInSpaceLowPoles = "I left the stove on!"
        EveInSpaceLowPoles = Nope. No ice at these poles. Just more purple water and dust.

        EveInSpaceLowMidlands = If purple is the color of royalty, Eve is certainly regal!
        EveInSpaceLowMidlands = Some of the rolling hills are large enough to be picked out from orbit.

        EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = "Come on, cosmos! Do your worst!"
        EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = You wonder if you could light the ocean on fire.

        EveInSpaceLowLowlands = The Lowlands are the closest thing Eve has to some coastal plains.
        EveInSpaceLowLowlands = Most low-altitude areas are on the east and western shores of the primary ocean.

        EveInSpaceLowHighlands = You wonder if you will ever be returning home. Probably not.
        EveInSpaceLowHighlands = Most of Eve's land surface is covered in these low hills.

        EveInSpaceLowPeaks = These are some proper mountains. You feel proud of them.
        EveInSpaceLowPeaks = Can we please not land on those big, spiky mountains?

        EveInSpaceLowImpactEjecta = "It has been an honor."
        EveInSpaceLowImpactEjecta = You trace the outlines of the craters' ejecta systems to take your mind off the landing.

        EveInSpaceLowCraterLake = The Crater is double the size of Kerbin's biggest. Everything is bigger on Eve, even the cosmic gunshot scars.
        EveInSpaceLowCraterLake = The rebound peak in the middle of the lake that fills the basin makes a prominent island in the centre.

        EveInSpaceLowWesternSea = A thin, elongated, scraggly inland sea carving a slash through the landmass.
        EveInSpaceLowWesternSea = It doesn't look very impressive, but no doubt it seems much bigger from downstairs.

        EveInSpaceLowOlympus = The highest peaks on Eve. You're torn between thinking they would make a good landing site for their altitude, or bad for their spikiness.
        EveInSpaceLowOlympus = You feel like a god, looking down on your domain from the heavens.

        EveInSpaceLowEasternSea = If you squint, it looks like a stretched trilobite. That's just me, isn't it?
        EveInSpaceLowEasternSea = The ocean sparkles and shines as light dapples off the water.

        //EveInSpaceLowCraters = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceLowFoothills = Lumpy land ahoy! Such pretender mountains.
        EveInSpaceLowFoothills = A burst of noise over comms breaks your concentration and makes you forget the notes you were making.

        //EveInSpaceLowAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveInSpaceLowShallows = Those oceans look flammable. You'd like to see the explosion if you dropped a match in.
        EveInSpaceLowShallows = Those shapes under the surface must be giant sea monsters. Mission Control gives their end of the radio a dope-slap.

        EveInSpaceHigh = From this position you can clearly make out lakes and oceans of some kind on the surface below.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve looks almost inviting from up here. You, however, know better than to listen to its siren call.
        EveInSpaceHigh = A vivid green aurora blossoms over Eve's poles. Eve can be beautiful when it wants to be.
