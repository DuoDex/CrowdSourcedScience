        EveSrfLanded = The toss of a pebble suggests that the atmosphere is REALLY, REALLY thick.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = "Should I take the left foot or the right foot?" The decision weighs heavy on your shoulders - literally.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The thick atmosphere makes it difficult to move around. You swear that if not for the high gravity, you could hover a bit just by flapping your arms.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = You decide to take a short walk, but think better of it after the first few steps.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder what jerk put lead weights in your suit.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = You feel like you may have put on some weight.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The extreme pressure is making it hard to move. Thankfully, you can still wiggle your toes.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You should have done more exercise back on Kerbin.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveSrfSplashed = You had a dream like this once. Unlike the dream, however, this isn't grape soda, and robot dolphins are not swimming in it.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = You realize swimming in a spacesuit is harder than you thought. You regret the decision of leaving the ship.

        //EveSrfSplashedLowlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks =

        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedShallows =

        EveFlyingLow = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.

        //EveFlyingLowPoles =
        //EveFlyingLowMidlands =

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = "Nuts."

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn't hurt to taste it... right?

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The purple behemoth dares you to slip.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = "I will not give up, I will not give in! I will land boots down, I will stand again."

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = You start to think that it's entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere.

        //EveFlyingLowCraterLake =
        //EveFlyingLowWesternSea =
        //EveFlyingLowOlympus =
        //EveFlyingLowEasternSea =
        //EveFlyingLowCraters =
        //EveFlyingLowFoothills =
        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake =
        //EveFlyingLowShallows =

        EveFlyingHigh = "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!"

        EveInSpaceLow = "I left the stove on!"

        //EveInSpaceLowPoles =

        EveInSpaceLowMidlands = I feel like my helmet is dissolving. Oh wait... IT IS! Get me back in, now!

        EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = "Come on, cosmos! Do your worst!"

        EveInSpaceLowLowlands = You wonder if you could light the ocean on fire.

        EveInSpaceLowHighlands = You wonder if you will ever be returning home. Probably not.

        //EveInSpaceLowPeaks =

        EveInSpaceLowImpactEjecta = "It has been an honor."

        //EveInSpaceLowCraterLake =
        //EveInSpaceLowWesternSea =
        //EveInSpaceLowOlympus =
        //EveInSpaceLowEasternSea =
        //EveInSpaceLowCraters =
        //EveInSpaceLowFoothills =
        //EveInSpaceLowAkatsukiLake =
        //EveInSpaceLowShallows =

        EveInSpaceHigh = From this position you can clearly make out lakes and oceans of some kind on the surface below.
