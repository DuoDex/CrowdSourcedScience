        EveSrfLanded = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.
        EveSrfLanded = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.
        EveSrfLanded = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.
        EveSrfLanded = You hear a hissing sound, like something is leaking.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = It's buried the needle!

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any Kerbals there.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The pressure is cursing down here! You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You start laughing at the abnormally high reading as you realize you're going to be stuck here for a long time.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You calculate the amount of Delta-V just to escape the atmosphere is greater than that it took to both escape Kerbin's and get here!
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You tap the glass of the barometer. Nope, it's not broken.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = It's over 9000...m/s! Well, the Delta-V required to escape the atmosphere anyways.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing".

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.

        //EveSrfLandedOlympus =
        //EveSrfLandedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedCraters =
        //EveSrfLandedFoothills =
        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveSrfSplashed = The pressure is very high. You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this purple sea.
        EveSrfSplashed = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Atmosphere? Yes!

        //EveSrfSplashedLowlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks =
        //EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta =

        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedShallows =

        EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
        EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
        EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
        EveFlyingLow = You secretly wish your friends and family the best as landing here may be the last landing you'll ever make.

        EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.

        //EveInSpaceLow =

        //EveInSpaceHigh =
