        EveSrfLandedPoles = It's buried the needle!
        EveSrfLandedPoles = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any Kerbals there.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The manual for the barometer claims it is rated up to 40atm. You start to doubt the validity of that claim.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The pressure is crushing down here! You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = You start laughing at the abnormally high reading as you realize you're going to be stuck here for a long time.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = It's over 9000...m/s! Well, the Delta-V required to escape the atmosphere anyways.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing".
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = I tell you what is high, and that's the atmospheric pressure. Some altitude this is.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = Whatever you think of the place, the barometer works at least. That alone is a win.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You hear a hissing sound, like something is leaking.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = You tap the glass of the barometer. Nope, it's not broken.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = All this pressure will make it difficult to take off. At least the beach is nearby. A crushed, corrosive, burning hot beach.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = So high above the lower reaches, the atmospheric pressure is less extreme. It's still very high, though.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = You tap the gauge on the barometer, and it goes down rather than up for once.

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = Wow, that's high. Are you sure they didn't leave something leaning on the sensor?
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = You calculate the amount of Delta-V just to escape the atmosphere is greater than that it took to both escape Kerbin's and get here!

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = Much to your disappointment, the theory of pressure being slightly lower at the poles has been disproven.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Atmosphere? Yes! Way too much of it, in fact.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The pressure is very high. You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this deep purple sea.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = The pressure is standard for sea level, which means the liquid level in this crater must be in line with the global sea level.

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = As you flick the detector on and watch the needle rise, so does your heart rate.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = Crater Lake? More like Crusher Lake.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = Five atmospheres. What was that about five being a lucky number?
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = The device logs minute changes in pressure as the craft bobs up and down on the tiny waves.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = Judging by how the craft is floating, the pressure would be immense under the surface as well.
        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = You can't tell the exact pressure after the labels burned off. Not like you really need to know the minutiae, anyway.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = Sea level pressure on Eve is the same everywhere, it seems.
        EveSrfSplashedShallows = You don't want to look at the barometer, so you distract yourself by looking out over the sea instead.

        EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
        EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
        EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
        EveFlyingLow = You secretly wish your friends and family the best as landing here may be the last landing you'll ever make.

        EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.
        EveFlyingHigh = High? You call this high? I tell you what is high, and that's the pressure!
        EveFlyingHigh = You don't like where you're going, and the data from the barometer only makes you even more concerned.

        EveInSpaceLow = A vacuum couldn't be more of a far cry from the conditions at the surface.
        EveInSpaceLow = The readout from the barometer spells "DONT SEND ME DOWN THERE". You concur.

        EveInSpaceHigh = There's no air up here. Not even Eve's mighty atmosphere makes it this far into space.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve watches you malevolently as you feel the compulsion to measure the air pressure in space.
