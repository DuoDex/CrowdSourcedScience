        EveSrfLandedPoles* = You look at the Goo and think that you see an image of a Kerbal. When you look back again, all you see is the standard routine of being crushed under the atmospheric pressure.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands* = The Goo looks stressed. Perhaps it's under a lot of pressure?

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea* = The Goo is also looking purple here. What else is new?

        EveSrfLandedLowlands* = The Goo tries to escape, but can't seem to get up the sides of the container.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands* = The Goo sits calmly bubbling away, showing no signs of being affected by a magnetic field. Maybe Eve releases gas from its surface to replace the atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks* = The Goo looks very... purpley.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta* = Looking relieved, the Goo slumps to the bottom of the container.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake* = The Goo looks very distressed.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea* = The Goo is dense and viscous and sticks itself to the bottom of the canister.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus* = The Goo lumps up in the middle of the container. Is it afraid of falling out?

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea* = The Goo is fanning itself.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters* =

        EveSrfLandedFoothills* = The Goo has completely flattened against the bottom of the canister. A tendril extends slowly towards you, as if to say: "Can we go home now?"

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake* =

        EveSrfLandedShallows* = The Goo has produced a cooler and offers you a tiny cold beer.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles* = The Goo is trying to beat back the sea from its container.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands* =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea* = Some local fluids have seeped into the container. The Goo vehemently avoids the stuff.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands* = The Goo has donned a hazmat suit. Maybe you should too.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands* =
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks* =

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta* = The Goo tentatively reaches out to the liquid, but recoils back.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake* = The Goo appears to have merged with the liquid.
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea* = The Goo has escaped into the purple liquid and seems to be waving goodbye as it floats away.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus* =

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea* = The Goo breaks free of the canister, excited for a swim. Upon contact with the purple liquid, however, it quickly returns and curls up in the corner.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters* =
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills* =
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake* =

        EveSrfSplashedShallows* = A tiny wave washes over the canister. The Goo panics.

        EveFlyingLow* = The Goo now appears like a straw blown painting. It looks distinctly purple but so does everything else.
        EveFlyingLow* = The Goo's structure is being blown and reformed by the wind as you fly.

        EveFlyingHigh* = The Goo is building its own rocket, not trusting you to bring it back home.
        EveFlyingHigh* = The Goo has either completely disappeared or been bleached purple.

        EveInSpaceLow* = The Goo indicates to you that it would prefer a different travel destination.
        EveInSpaceLow* = The Goo stares nervously at Eve.

        EveInSpaceHigh* = The Goo is staring towards the planet. Is it homesick?
        EveInSpaceHigh* = The Goo is practicing turning purple to blend in.
