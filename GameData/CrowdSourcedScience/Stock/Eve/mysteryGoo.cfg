        EveSrfLandedPoles = You look at the Goo and think that you see an image of a Kerbal. When you look back again, all you see is the standard routine of being crushed under the atmospheric pressure.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The Goo looks stressed. Perhaps it's under a lot of pressure?

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The Goo is also looking purple here. What else is new?

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The Goo tries to escape, but can't seem to get up the sides of the container.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The Goo sits calmly bubbling away, showing no signs of being affected by a magnetic field. Maybe Eve releases gas from its surface to replace the atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The Goo looks very... purpley.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Looking relieved, the Goo slumps to the bottom of the container.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = The Goo looks very distressed.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = The Goo is dense and viscous and sticks itself to the bottom of the canister.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = The Goo lumps up in the middle of the container. Is it afraid of falling out?

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The Goo is fanning itself.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = The Goo has completely flattened against the bottom of the canister. A tendril extends slowly towards you, as if to say: "Can we go home now?"

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = The Goo has produced a cooler and offers you a tiny cold beer.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = The Goo is trying to beat back the sea from its container.

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Some local fluids have seeped into the container. The Goo vehemently avoids the stuff.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = The Goo has donned a hazmat suit. Maybe you should too.

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = The Goo tentatively reaches out to the liquid, but recoils back.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = The Goo appears to have merged with the liquid.
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = The Goo has escaped into the purple liquid and seems to be waving goodbye as it floats away.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The Goo breaks free of the canister, excited for a swim. Upon contact with the purple liquid, however, it quickly returns and curls up in the corner.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = A tiny wave washes over the canister. The Goo panics.

        EveFlyingLow = The Goo now appears like a straw blown painting. It looks distinctly purple but so does everything else.
        EveFlyingLow = The Goo's structure is being blown and reformed by the wind as you fly.

        EveFlyingHigh = The Goo is building its own rocket, not trusting you to bring it back home.
        EveFlyingHigh = The Goo has either completely disappeared or been bleached purple.

        EveInSpaceLow = The Goo indicates to you that it would prefer a different travel destination.
        EveInSpaceLow = The Goo stares nervously at Eve.

        EveInSpaceHigh = The Goo is staring towards the planet. Is it homesick?
        EveInSpaceHigh = The Goo is practicing turning purple to blend in.
