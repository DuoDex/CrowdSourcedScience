        EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks very distressed.
        EveSrfLanded = The Goo has completely flattened against the bottom of the canister. A tendril extends slowly towards you, as if to say: "Can we go home now?"
        EveSrfLanded = The Goo is dense and viscous and sticks itself to the bottom of the canister.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = You look at the Goo and think that you see an image of a Kerbal. When you look back again, all you see is the standard routine of being crushed under the atmospheric pressure.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = The Goo looks stressed. Perhaps it's under a lot of pressure?

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The Goo is also looking purple here. What else is new?

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The Goo tries to escape, but can't seem to get up the sides of the container.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The Goo lumps up in the middle of the container. Is it afraid of falling out?

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The Goo sits calmly bubbling away, showing no signs of being affected by a magnetic field. Maybe Eve releases gas from its surface to replace the atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The Goo looks very... purpley.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Looking relieved, the Goo slumps to the bottom of the container.

        //EveSrfLandedCraterLake =
        //EveSrfLandedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedOlympus =
        //EveSrfLandedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfLandedCraters =
        //EveSrfLandedFoothills =
        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfLandedShallows =

        EveSrfSplashed = The Goo breaks free of the canister, excited for a swim. Upon contact with the purple liquid, however, it quickly returns and curls up in the corner.
        EveSrfSplashed = The Goo has escaped into the purple liquid and seems to be waving goodbye as it floats away.
        EveSrfSplashed = The Goo appears to have merged with the liquid.

        //EveSrfSplashedPoles =
        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands =

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Some local fluids have seeped into the container. The Goo vehemently avoids the stuff.

        //EveSrfSplashedLowlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands =
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks =
        //EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta =
        //EveSrfSplashedCraterLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedWesternSea =
        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus =
        //EveSrfSplashedEasternSea =
        //EveSrfSplashedCraters =
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills =
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake =
        //EveSrfSplashedShallows =

        EveFlyingLow = The Goo now appears like a straw blown painting. It looks distinctly purple but so does everything else.

        EveFlyingHigh = The Goo has either completely disappeared or been bleached purple.

        EveInSpaceLow = The Goo indicates to you that it would prefer a different travel destination.

        EveInSpaceHigh = The Goo is staring towards the planet. Is it homesick?
