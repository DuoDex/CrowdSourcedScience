        EveSrfLandedPoles = Maybe smuggling some snacks into the command module wasn't a bad idea, after all.
        EveSrfLandedPoles = The Poles seem every bit as inhospitable as the rest of this pressure-cooker of a planet.

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You have a feeling that landing here may have been a bad idea.
        EveSrfLandedMidlands = "I want to go home".

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = You still cherish the hope that you packed enough fuel.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = The ship computer starts playing the tune to the song Purple Rain all on its own.
        EveSrfLandedLowlands = After hearing the creaks of your capsule, you regret visiting Eve.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = We have successfully landed on Eve! However, the crew is expressing doubts about the lander's ability to leave.
        EveSrfLandedHighlands = The purple souposphere swirls menacingly around the craft out of the windows.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The gravity is getting us down. Hopefully that doesn't include down the mountain.
        EveSrfLandedPeaks = There's nowhere flat around here, and the high gravity means it's a struggle to walk around the cabin and makes you constantly fall out of your chair.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Your crew asks Mission Control if snacks can be turned into fuel.
        EveSrfLandedImpactEJecta = You feel that your ship is under a lot of pressure.

        EveSrfLandedCraterLake = The purple sea sparkles nearby, looking innocent enough to those not in it.

        EveSrfLandedWesternSea = You don't fancy going outside, so you have a snack instead.

        EveSrfLandedOlympus = There's a lot of sky out of the window. Even the terrain is intimidating here on Eve.
        EveSrfLandedOlympus = That altimeter is still reading awful high. Are you sure we've actually landed?

        EveSrfLandedEasternSea = Purple sea, purple sky, purple ground. You rub your eyes and search in vain for something not purple.

        //EveSrfLandedCraters = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedFoothills = The more you look at them, the more the rolling purple hills start to blend together as a blur.
        EveSrfLandedFoothills = Even Eve has baby mountains. Naturally, they're bigger than Kerbin's.

        //EveSrfLandedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfLandedShallows = Flat coastal plains provide an ideal landing spot for craft, but not one for taking off from.

        EveSrfSplashedPoles = The ocean is feeling a bit too cold...

        //EveSrfSplashedMidlands = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Explodium, you say? Can we turn this stuff into rocket fuel?.....it's just metaphorical? Aww.
        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = Mission Control assures you that it's grape juice outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins peeling the paint off the ship.

        EveSrfSplashedLowlands = Short circuit in Wire Five!

        //EveSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedPeaks = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedImpactEjecta = You catch a whiff of something chemical-y. Are you sure that hatch is closed properly?

        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = You see the purple liquid that is Eve's ocean leak into the capsule. You get the suspicion that you may be in big trouble.
        EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = This reminds you of a time you saw a man get trapped in a vat of grape soda. Unfortunately, you can't drink your way out of this one.

        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = Even though your suit should be airtight, you swear that the capsule reeks faintly of nail polish remover.
        EveSrfSplashedWesternSea = A small wave slaps against the craft, causing you to lose your balance in the high gravity and fall over again.

        //EveSrfSplashedOlympus = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = As you see the purple ocean surrounding you, you start to wonder how you'll ever get back home.
        EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = This stuff probably has so many uses, and you could make a killing off of it if you could only figure out how to bring it back with you.

        //EveSrfSplashedCraters = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedFoothills = [N/A]
        //EveSrfSplashedAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveSrfSplashedShallows = We're bouncing a bit too much here.
        EveSrfSplashedShallows = You're pretty sure this (isn't) grape juice.

        EveFlyingLowPoles = The wind and crew are screaming.
        EveFlyingLowPoles = You start having second thoughts about landing...

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = They said that the crew would be getting a raise when they returned, but you've never heard of anyone getting a raise. Ever. We're not even paid!

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = After looking through the window, you inform Mission Control you figured out where all the grape soda from the break room fridge keeps going.
        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = The ocean is nearly mirror-flat.

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = You get a sudden urge for grape juice.
        EveFlyingLowLowlands = Flying through the soupy air is a slow process.

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The crew wonders if there are enough snacks.
        EveFlyingLowHighlands = Small air currents are amplified in power by the high atmospheric density, and the craft rocks as it flies.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = Mountains rise all around you to stab into the heavy sky.
        EveFlyingLowPeaks = The communications system crackles with unknown interference.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = The equipment is strained to the limits. We should be fine, as long as we don't make any sudden movements.
        EveFlyingLowImpactEjects = A blob of molten exterior paint slowly crawls up the window glass.

        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = The Crater Lake extends for miles towards the horizon. Why isn't it called the Crater Sea?
        EveFlyingLowCraterLake = There's no alien sea monsters down there, right?

        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = The vile lake shimmers beneath the crushing atmosphere.
        EveFlyingLowWesternSea = You try not to imagine what getting stuck in that liquid would be like.

        EveFlyingLowOlympus = Please don't try and land here. We don't want to end up as debris on a mountainside.
        EveFlyingLowOlympus = The disconnect between the sea-level and radar altimeters is scarily large.

        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = The presence of a sluggish gust of wind moving across the sea is betrayed by a patch of ripples.
        EveFlyingLowEasternSea = The capsule window glass feels uncomfortably warm to the touch.

        //EveFlyingLowCraters = [N/A]

        EveFlyingLowFoothills = You can't see the edge of the hills, even from here.
        EveFlyingLowFoothills = The manufacturer offered us our money back if the capsule gets crushed, so there's that at least.

        //EveFlyingLowAkatsukiLake = [N/A]

        EveFlyingLowShallows = You could swear you see shapes lurking under the purple surface.
        EveFlyingLowShallows = As you look out at the sea, its purple color reminds you of your favorite soft drink.

        EveFlyingHigh = After various tests you can confirm that it is indeed "very purple".
        EveFlyingHigh = A tendril of glowing plasma streams off of a protruding rivet.
        EveFlyingHigh = Atmospheric entry is dangerous here. Praying to your relevant deity is recommended to alleviate stress.
        EveFlyingHigh = High above the toxic clouds and crushing pressure, things don't seem quite so bad.

        EveInSpaceLow = What smells like purple?
        EveInSpaceLow = Well, purple is your favorite color. Maybe there are purple flowers you can take home?
        EveInSpaceLow = That is definitely a deep commitment to purple.
        EveInSpaceLow = The world looks incredibly toxic and inhospitable.

        EveInSpaceHigh = You think you see Gilly, but it turns out to be a spare peanut.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve's sky glows a beautiful green on the terminator, between day and night.
        EveInSpaceHigh = The atmosphere shimmers like rocket fuel.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve looks beautiful from up here. You suspect this to be a ruse to lull you into a false sense of security.
