        EveSrfLanded = After hearing the creaks of your capsule you regret visiting Eve.
        EveSrfLanded = "I want to go home".
        EveSrfLanded = You feel that your ship is under a lot of pressure.

        EveSrfLandedPoles = You start having second thoughts about landing...

        EveSrfLandedMidlands = You have a feeling that landing here may have been a bad idea.

        EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = You still cherish the hope that you packed enough fuel.

        EveSrfLandedLowlands = Maybe smuggling some snacks into the command module wasn't a bad idea, after all.

        EveSrfLandedHighlands = We have successfully landed on Eve! However, the crew is expressing doubts about the landers ability to leave.

        EveSrfLandedPeaks = The gravity is getting to us.

        EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = Your crew asks Mission Control if snacks can be turned into fuel.

        EveSrfSplashed = Even though your suit should be airtight, you swear that the capsule reeks faintly of nail polish remover.
        EveSrfSplashed = As you look out at the sea, its purple color reminds you of your favorite soft drink.
        EveSrfSplashed = You see the purple liquid that is Eve's ocean leak into the capsule. You get the suspicion that you may be in big trouble.
        EveSrfSplashed = This reminds you of a time you saw a man get trapped in a vat of grape soda. Unfortunately, you can't drink your way out of this one.
        EveSrfSplashed = Mission Control assures you that it's grape juice outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins peeling the paint off the ship.
        EveSrfSplashed = You're pretty sure this (isn't) grape juice.
        EveSrfSplashed = We're bouncing a bit too much here.
        EveSrfSplashed = The ocean is feeling a bit too cold...
        EveSrfSplashed = Short circuit in Wire Five!

        EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = As you see the purple ocean surrounding you, you start to wonder how you'll ever get back home.

        EveFlyingLow = If purple is the color of royalty, Eve is certainly regal!

        EveFlyingLowPoles = The wind and crew are screaming.

        EveFlyingLowMidlands = They said that the crew would be getting a raise when they returned, but you've never heard of anyone getting a raise. Ever.

        EveFlyingLowExplodiumSea = Vile lakes shimmer beneath the crushing atmosphere.

        EveFlyingLowLowlands = You get a sudden urge for grape juice.

        EveFlyingLowHighlands = The crew wonders if there are enough snacks.

        EveFlyingLowPeaks = After looking through the window, you inform Mission Control you figured out where all the grape soda from the break room fridge keeps going.

        EveFlyingLowImpactEjecta = The equipment is strained to the limits. We should be fine, as long as we don't make any sudden movements.

        EveFlyingHigh = After various tests you can confirm that it is indeed "very purple".

        EveInSpaceLow = What smells like purple?
        EveInSpaceLow = Well, purple is your favorite color. Maybe there are purple flowers you can take home?
        EveInSpaceLow = Those oceans look flammable. You'd like to see the explosion if you dropped a match in.
        EveInSpaceLow = The world looks incredibly toxic and inhospitable.

        EveInSpaceHigh = You think you see Gilly, but it turns out to be a spare peanut.
        EveInSpaceHigh = That is definitely a deep commitment to purple.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve's sky glows a beautiful green on the terminator, between day and night.
        EveInSpaceHigh = The atmosphere shimmers like rocket fuel.
        EveInSpaceHigh = Eve looks beautiful from up here. You suspect this to be a ruse to lull you into a false sense of security.
