        MunSrfLanded* = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.

        MunSrfLandedMidlands* = Ahh, the Midlands. The only flat place on this not-made-of-cheese rock.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = Another place to gain the 'First snack ever eaten here in the history of Kerbalkind' achievement. Let's get to it!

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater* = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater* = This would be an awesome spot to film a movie. "North by Northwest Crater".

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater* = This would be a great spot for the first Munar music festival. 'South by Southwest Crater'

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater* = Boy, the lighting up here sure looks weird. Almost as if you were on a sound stage or something.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons* = Seeing the dark canyon makes you wonder what wonders lie down there.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater* = It feels strangely dangerous out there. Mission Control insists it's safe, but you don't think they would know very well.

        MunSrfLandedPoles* = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands* = You put on your polarized aviator sunglasses. Now you can look cool AND be situationally appropriate.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands* = You survey the vista that spreads out before you as you munch on some snacks.

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters* = Struck by a sudden urge to say something witty, you nearly choke on your snack.

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters* = You muse on the chances of having landed in this specific crater. Oh yeah, we picked it from data from a pre-scan mission. There was a pre-scan mission, right?!

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater* = You begin to indicate concerns regarding whether or not the landing was simply an elaborate hoax, but the communications are interrupted by a strange voice telling you to keep quiet.

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters* = The twin craters remind you of some other twin things. But we won't get into that here.

        //MunSrfLandedLowlands* =
        //MunSrfLandedFarsideBasin* =

        MunInSpaceLow* = You resist the urge to take your craft down even lower and 'thread the needle'.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You glance out your window at the surface... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
        MunInSpaceLow* = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Looking down at the Mun's surface, you suddenly feel tempted to eat cheese.
        MunInSpaceLow* = "Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it's much bigger than we thought it was."
        MunInSpaceLow* = Great, we've made it this far! Now, how to land?
        MunInSpaceLow* = Wasn't there an opera written about this once?
        MunInSpaceLow* = You don't know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be... interesting.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Ah the "East Crater". Yes, now that you're up close you can definitely tell which one it is. You totally didn't look at the map.
        MunInSpaceLow* = ANOTHER crater?! Does this place have ANY flat land??
        MunInSpaceLow* = You wonder if your report can even make it back to Kerbin from here - you are on the Farside of the Mun, after all.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You report to Mission Control that you have found no evidence of the long-standing claim that a cow jumped over the Mun.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You try to decide which area would make the best landing spot. Then you make a back-up list of places that would make a good crash-landing spot.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Those highland craters think they're so much better than the other craters. Well they don't look so great from up here!
        MunInSpaceLow* = Crew report begins. I'm hungry. Will eat snacks. Crew report ends.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Without atmosphere, weather, or major seismic activity, the Mun's craters are remarkably well-preserved. You make sure to take plenty of pictures and note this in your report.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You remember watching a documentary on one of the leading theories explaining the formation of the Mun. It's hard to believe that the sterile surface below was once a literal sea of fire.
        MunInSpaceLow* = In addition to the rather round craters, there also appear to be areas that are far more irregular in shape. The scientists are calling these 'basins'.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You report that the ship makes scary noises at night and you can't sleep. Mission Control advises leaving on the night light.
        MunInSpaceLow* = You thank Mission Control for helping you get this far.
        MunInSpaceLow* = The Mun's Polar Lowlands don't seem that different from the rest of the Mun.
        MunInSpaceLow* = The crew is incredibly impressed with the engineering of this spacecraft. They especially admire the cleverly-recessed, climate-controlled snack bar.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Nothing to report Mission Control! Except for the fact that we're flying over the Mun but you already know that.
        MunInSpaceLow* = Those Twin Craters don't look very similar. Perhaps they are fraternal twins.

        MunInSpaceHigh* = From this high up, the canyons look like scars across the Mun's face. Which is appropriate considering how much the Mun has survived millennia after millennia.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You are very proud of yourself for reaching this far!
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You see a great sphere of moldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the Mun.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal's.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You look back at Kerbin. I looks rather small.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = It seems that the Mun is one big giant rock with no atmosphere.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Those craters... what could they be caused by?
        MunInSpaceHigh* = "Here I am floating in a tin can, far above the Mun."
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You wonder if those craters were caused by the impacts of launches before you. Mission Control laughs nervously and urges you otherwise.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You sketch a map of the munar surface with the intention of taking it home to frame and hang on your wall. And, because you have time, you make a few autographed copies to sell on kBay.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You gaze down at the crater below as crumbs from the snack you are eating fall out of your mouth.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Wow the Mun looks pretty beat up. Look at all those holes.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = The crater below reminds you of snacks. Of course everything reminds you of snacks.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You request a bedtime story from Mission Control.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Huh. The Mun kinda looks like a giant golf ball. You nervously keep an eye out for a giant golf club.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Staring at the crater-filled surface of the Mun you are suddenly thankful for Kerbin's thick atmosphere.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Ha the Mun is so small and adorab--holy crap, it's getting big really fast.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = All systems nominal. The ship is happy so you're happy.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = Watching the pockmarked munar surface get larger and larger as you get closer and closer is a sight you'll treasure forever.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You try to imagine the sheer kinetic energy released when whatever made those giant craters impacted. Must've been quite a sight.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You and Mission Control are playing Battleship over the radio. Curses! There goes your kruiser.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You take out your sketchbook and make a drawing of the munar surface. Then you give it a smiley face so it looks happy to see you!
        MunInSpaceHigh* = As you approach the Mun, you take the time to rehearse several contingency plans in case of an emergency.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = You take the time to study the schematics of your spacecraft. You are greatly impressed and slightly worried at how many corners were cut during its design and construction.
        MunInSpaceHigh* = The Twin Craters remind you of a cell dividing.
