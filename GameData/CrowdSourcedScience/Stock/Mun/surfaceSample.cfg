        MunSrfLanded = Done and dusted.
        MunSrfLanded = You take a sample and confirm that the Mun is not made of cheese.
        MunSrfLanded = Wensleydale? Stilton? It isn't like any cheese you've tasted. You wonder if its actually cheese at all.
        MunSrfLanded = You suddenly realize why the physical examination screened for breathing problems.
        MunSrfLanded = Oddly enough, the sample smells similar to Swiss cheese. One wonders if it's edible.
        MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.
        MunSrfLanded = Unfortunately, it's not cheese. You double-check it, but it still isn't.
        MunSrfLanded = You note the sample's lack of cheese.
        MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a grayish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.
        MunSrfLanded = Finally, something that isn't dirt: a rock!
        MunSrfLanded = So, breccias are actually kind of boring.
        MunSrfLanded = Through extensive and professional testing, you find out that, contrary to popular belief, the Mun is not made of cheese. Also, you immediately regret your testing.
        MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
        MunSrfLanded = The lead scientists back at KSP go against your idea to grill your sample between two pieces of bread.

        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The ground appears to be made of very small, sharp, abrasive pieces of gray rock. It would probably be best if you didn't rub your space suit against the stuff.
        MunSrfLandedMidlands = Very... rocky.
        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The darker midlands surface appears to be made up of basaltic rocks.
        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The sample contains odd glass spherules of various colors. They're quite pretty!

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The sample contains evidence of a weak, localized magnetic field.
        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The surface here consists of multiple types of rock. Some appear almost crystalline.

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = There are high concentrations of metals in this crater.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = The ground materials appear to be a combination of basaltic rocks and breccia.
        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = Deeper samples seems to contain more fragmented and shattered formations of rock.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The sample appears to be radioactive.
        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = There appears to be layers of completely different materials here. It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Tiny flecks of purple flesh dot the mineral deposits here. The texture of the crater looks quite puckered. Is this evidence that this was once the home of the legendary Kraken?
        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured here.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = To your surprise, you find a large lump of ice lodged in the center of the crater. Upon further analysis you find that it doesn't taste particularly well, and is too chunky for the snow-cone machine.
        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = You examine the sample you've collected, and throw it into the container for further testing.
        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.

        MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder if this would make a nice snack.
        MunSrfLandedPoles = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.
        MunSrfLandedPoles = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realize that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
        MunSrfLandedPoles = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The sample seems to contain frozen liquids... we should send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = You take a small rock and your nine iron, place the rock on a T, and knock it into low orbit.
        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The Mun dust here is light and thin... It's very poor sandcastle-building material. That doesn't stop you from making one.
        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = Seems muddy, in a waterless kind of way. You find it appropriate to remove your shoes before boarding the ship again, no thought given to the problems of removing space attire while still outside.
        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = This crater seems to filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for something neat.
        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Then, you throw a less cool looking rock into the sample container.

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = This crater must have had a really nasty impact, the samples are heavier than normal.
        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = You're glad that the Mun's gravity is so low. Digging is backbreaking work!

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Definitely not Cheddar. Winchester? No. Dorset Blue Vinney? Nah.
        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = This area has a particularly high concentration of rare elements. Nice!
        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Continual samples of this area confirm it is rich in useful materials.
        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You dig around for a nice sample of the crater, carefully selecting some of everything.
