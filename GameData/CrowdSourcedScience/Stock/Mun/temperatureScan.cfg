        MunSrfLanded = The thermometer can't seem to make up its mind whether it's hot or cold here.

        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The surface here seems to reflect much of the Sun's heat. As a result, it's slightly cooler here.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The blackened rocks absorb and radiate large quantities of the Sun's heat. You briefly consider the idea of sunbathing, but realize you don't have a beach towel. Oh well...

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The temperature fluctuates wildly with the rotation of the moon, as the crater moves from day to night.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = The inclined angle of the solar radiation at this latitude has a marked effect on the temperature, which you make note of in your report.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The temperature here is rather boring. That's right, I said it. Boring. B-O-R-I-N-G!

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Between the dusty atmosphere and the reduced light in the crater it is difficult to read the thermometer.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = The thermometer is shivering from the cold. With the high walls blocking all the sunlight, this is not surprising.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It's pretty cold here. You'd almost think Kerbol hadn't shined in this crater since it was formed!

        MunSrfLandedPoles = The thermometer pressure vessel seems to have sprung a leak, and all the liquid inside boiled off into space. Hope the same thing doesn't happen to the rest of the ship.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Seems like a great snack-time temperature. Let's make it happen!

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature reminds you how nice it really is back on Kerbin.

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The long shadows cast by the crater rims make this region colder than the surrounding highlands.

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You're unsure about the surrounding area, but your temperature is definitely elevated after that landing. Wooohooo!

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = It's chilly. You want to take a walk around the canyon rim to warm up.

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You aren't sure which crater to take the temperature in, so you pick one at random. After all they're twins, so the readings should be the same, right?

        MunInSpaceLow = While waiting for the temperature scan to finish, you sketch the patterns made by the Mun's canyons.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature here is wholly uninteresting compared to the box of snacks in your hand.
        MunInSpaceLow = You read the thermal data and sadly put away your flip-flops.
        MunInSpaceLow = It appears to be noticeably closer on the dark side of the Mun. Nothing you aren't prepared for though.
        MunInSpaceLow = You quickly write down your results in the knowledge that thermometers don't often respond well to lithobraking maneuvers.
        MunInSpaceLow = Well that was quite expected. You consider throwing the thermometer into the microwave just to shake things up.
        MunInSpaceLow = You use the thermometer to bake your snack at the perfect temperature. Then you send readings back to Mission Control just how they react.
        MunInSpaceLow = The thermometer barely moves so you give it a good swift kick.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature shifts ever so slowly as you pass sedately over the munar surface.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature in orbit low around the Mun is much as that of outer space. Perhaps because technically it's outer space.
        MunInSpaceLow = Temperatures here are well within expectations. Still, it's better to have the hard data to confirm.
        MunInSpaceLow = You have lost the thermometer. You make up some data with impressive-looking figures to send back to KSC. Bigger numbers are better, right?
        MunInSpaceLow = The Mun doesn't seem to retain the Sun's warmth very well. Thermometer readings on the bright side are still pretty darn cold.
        MunInSpaceLow = The thermometer is reading the space outside as rather warm. That can't be right... Oh wait, you're sitting on it.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature readings make you glad they installed a heater in this thing. You give it a few swift kicks to make sure it's still working.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature in munar orbit remains fairly constant until you enter the dark side.
        MunInSpaceLow = The temperature rises and falls as you leave and enter the Mun's shadow.
