        MunSrfLanded = That's one small step fo- the situation is nominal.
        MunSrfLanded = That's one small step for a Kerbal, and one big cupboard of snacks for said Kerbal.
        MunSrfLanded = You notice some weird rocks in the distance.
        MunSrfLanded = You're in a most peculiar way, and the stars look very different today.
        MunSrfLanded = A small rock cracks your visor. You begin to question EVA on a surface with no atmosphere.

        MunSrfLandedMidlands = As you step off your lander, saying the usual dramatic speech, Mission Control calls up, tells you to cut the chatter and to take the all-important surface sample.
        MunSrfLandedMidlands = You look up and hope that the rocket scientists back on Kerbin did their math correctly.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = "Did I leave the keys in the ignition?"

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = You feel a peculiar quake. When you look behind you, there is a fresh meteor impacted where you were just walking.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = You should have brought your golf club.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = That dust is getting into everything! Now stop staring and help me clean my visor!

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = You wonder how that rock got into your spacesuit.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = You spot a narrow part of the canyon, and wonder if you could make the jump across.
        MunSrfLandedCanyons = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Feeling slightly bored, you play peek-a-boo with Kerbin over the crater edges.

        MunSrfLandedPoles = You hum "You never make me be like you/I'm master of the moon."
        MunSrfLandedPoles = You are amazed at how mystifying the moon scenery looks like from the pole.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = You confirm that the Mun is not made out of cheese. Mission Control is very sad.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = As it turns out, there's no cheese!

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = It doesn't -taste- like it's made of dairy...

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You really want to jump again, but last time Mission Control yelled at you.

        //MunSrfLandedLowlands =
        //MunSrfLandedFarsideBasin =

        MunInSpaceLow = "I wonder if it tastes like cheese? Nah. Minmus though..."

        MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Despite being relatively flat, the Midlands is still littered with debris from impact ejecta, making choosing a landing site a non-trivial matter.

        MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = As you study the Northern Basin from low-orbit EVA you suddenly feel the an overwhelming urge to pee...

        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You stare at the Mun amazed at how fast you are moving over the surface; maybe going out of the capsule was a bad decision.
        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = It's hard to tell from outside the cockpit, but you think that you might be really low. You're not... in the crater, are you?
        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You Stare at the Mun amazed at how fast you are moving over the surface; maybe going out of the capsule was a bad decision.

        MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Hmm... this Northwest Crater doesn't appear to be as round as some of the other ones. Perhaps the lava cooled unevenly. Or something.

        MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = The Southwest Crater is really rather round. The impact must have hit almost perpendicular to the surface.

        MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = Hmm not bad. Still, you'd like to see the West Nearside Crater before making the final decision on which crater is the fairest of them all.

        MunInSpaceLowCanyons = There are visible striations in the walls of the canyons.
        MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The canyons below look particularly fun to climb. If only you weren't moving t such a high relative velocity...

        MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = You wish you could've witnessed the devastating impact that created the Mun's vast Polar Crater. From a safe distance of course.

        MunInSpaceLowPoles = Aw, the Mun's Poles don't have auroras... Oh hey, you can see Kerbin's from here!

        MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = If this was Kerbin, you'd be seeing ice sheets by now. Oh well, EVAs are still fun.

        MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The scientists have explained that the munar highlands are likely plagioclase cumulates. You're not quite sure what that means.
        MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The Mun's Highlands look alright. But you still wish there was some kind of munar mountain!

        MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = After you complete your allotted activities, you let go of the ship and float freely over the Mun's Highland Craters.

        MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = Holy crap there's a lot of them... which means there's plenty to go around when they start naming things after people!

        MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You're not a fan of the name "East Farside Crater". You really hope you land down there so they can name it after you instead.
        MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You wish you brought a skateboard. Those crater walls would make an awesome halfpipe.

        MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = What an oddly-shaped crater. Are they two different impacts? Or perhaps the result of an impactor hitting at an angle and skipping across the surface.

        //MunInSpaceLowLowlands =
        //MunInSpaceLowFarsideBasin =

        MunInSpaceHigh = Say are those the Munar Canyons down below? They sure are impressive. Nothing like Kerbin's of course.
        MunInSpaceHigh = It looks like a really big rock.
        MunInSpaceHigh = All you can think about is potatoes...
        MunInSpaceHigh = You're trying to decide how to describe this moment to the folks back home. You probably shouldn't mention the part where you peed inside your suit.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You can see the ridge of the crater below much more clearly through just the visor of your spacesuit. Why did we bring a spaceship anyway?
        MunInSpaceHigh = You gave up counting the craters when you ran out of fingers for the ninth time.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You stare through the not-so-vast expanse between you and the Mun. Who knew it was this big.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Ahhhh. No one can hear you rip one loose way out here.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Entering the dark side of the Mun and losing contact with Mission Control makes you realize just how isolated you are from the rest of your kind.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Well there she is. You should probably rehearse your awesome, historic speech before you land.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You wonder if there's someone back on Kerbin watching the Mun through a telescope right now. You wave a few times in case they can see you.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Mission Control insists on guiding you step-by-step through this spacewalk. As a small act of rebellion, you do everything upside-down. They'll never know! Even you can't tell if you're really upside-down or not.
        MunInSpaceHigh = As you carry out your EVA you feel your nose get progressively itchier. The resulting sneeze almost spins you out of control.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Huh the Mun looks surprisingly like the one in your high school textbook. Probably the end result of hundreds of years of Kerbal curiosity. And telescopes. Really big telescopes.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You hear a sudden hissing from your space suit. Thankfully, it turns out it was just the snacks from last night.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You roam around the outside of your craft, marvelling at how such a contraption managed to get you this far.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You inspect your craft from the outside, going through the maintenance checklist provided by Mission Control.
        MunInSpaceHigh = As you carry out your EVA, you look over your spacecraft to make sure you're not missing too many pieces.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You could get used to peeing in this suit. Perhaps you should wear it all the time like a badass diaper.
