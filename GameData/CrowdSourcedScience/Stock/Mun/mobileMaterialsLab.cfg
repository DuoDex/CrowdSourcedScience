        MunSrfLanded = As you look away, one sample makes a run for it.

        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The munar soil has mixed with one of the materials, producing a gray paste that is getting everywhere.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = All the materials seem to be squished to the bottom of their containers. It takes you a while to complete your experiments.

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = Th materials promptly turn into a gooey mess from all the dust flying around at the surface.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = You keep hoping to see Carey Grant go running through the lab. No such luck.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The lab is cozy with the light reflecting off the crater outside. You pull out a box of snacks and get to work on it. Working on the labwork will come later.

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Working in a lab in a crater on the moon makes you feel like a mad scientist. You note this in your report.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = For a moment, one of the materials reflects a black shape somewhere on the distant surface.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = All the materials are polarized and sticking together. Is there ANYTHING that's not difficult in space?!

        MunSrfLandedPoles = Mobile Materials Lab - Polar Mun Report: Why did we bring this thing instead of more snacks? Thanks. - Signed, The Crew.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = You aren't quite sure of what to make of the lab results. Guess the scientists back on Kerbin can figure it out.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The vista from here is very distracting, so it takes you some extra time to complete your report.

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = As you complete your lab reports you look forward to EVA-ing and running down the slope of the crater to see how fast you can get going.

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find it difficult to finish your report with everything at an angle. There were so many craters around it was impossible to find a level landing site.

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = The materials promptly roll down the hill to the lowest part of the crater as soon as you open the canister. You guess that's why its a 'Mobile Materials' Lab.

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Perched between the two craters the materials seem to be divided equally in their containers. You note this in your report.

        //MunSrfLandedLowlands =
        //MunSrfLandedFarsideBasin =

        MunInSpaceLow = Your experiments are still unable to conclusively prove whether or not the Mun is made of cheese. You formally request permission to go lower.
        MunInSpaceLow = You gaze down at the crater below, absentmindedly stirring a flask of some unnamed substance.
        MunInSpaceLow = You hear repeated cries of "Are we there yet?" coming from the materials bay.
        MunInSpaceLow = You are too busy doodling the crater below to finish your lab experiments, so you send the doodle back to KSC instead of your report..
        MunInSpaceLow = After much deliberation, the samples have all agreed that the Mun does not in fact appear to be made of cheese. You proudly send this report back up to KSC.
        MunInSpaceLow = Your material tests indicate that similar metals brought into contact with one another form a strong bond when in vacuum. That should lead to some interesting developments in spaceflight.
        MunInSpaceLow = The materials lab is ready for action! You, however, need a snack first to get you going.
        MunInSpaceLow = Oh dear, it seems that you have misplaced your snack inside the materials bay. Now you can't tell what's edible and what's not.
        MunInSpaceLow = You pick a sample at random and subject it to a plethora of scientific examinations including the time-tested method of sticking it in your mouth to see what it tastes like.
        MunInSpaceLow = Watching the surface below, you can't help but think how great it would be if you had a munar surface sample to study using the equipment in your lavishly-equipped lab.
        MunInSpaceLow = The instructions on the materials bay claim that the samples inside can be used as an emergency food supply. You hope you brought enough snacks.
        MunInSpaceLow = Experimentation over the Mun has some interesting variances from experimentation above Kerbin.
        MunInSpaceLow = An experiment in munar orbit, how exciting! You can't wait to see how they compare with the results from Kerbin orbit.
        MunInSpaceLow = The materials bay door jams. You give it a few swift kicks until it pops open.
        MunInSpaceLow = Ah it's so nice to have your own laboratory far from the restrictions of Kerbin. No gravity and especially no safety supervisor!
        MunInSpaceLow = There seems to be an argument at Mission Control over which experiment to do first. You sit back and eat some snacks while waiting for them to decide.
        MunInSpaceLow = In today's experiment you observe your pet hamster's activities while in munar orbit gravity.

        MunInSpaceHigh = Your lab report is strategically written to convince the KSC to let you land on the Mun.
        MunInSpaceHigh = The samples ask to be woken up when you're on the Mun.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Why are we in a lab up here when we could be playing....erm, EVA-ing, in the crater below?
        MunInSpaceHigh = You fill your lab report with scribbled images of you planting a flag on the Mun (not to scale). You hope the folks back at KSC get the hint.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Wow, this place needs some acne medication.
        MunInSpaceHigh = You finish your lab report in time to catch a glimpse of the huge Farside Crater down below.
        MunInSpaceHigh = It's getting very difficult to keep track of your experiments as they float around in the low gravity. Maybe you shouldn't have tried to them all at once.
        MunInSpaceHigh = This particular experiment is from an elementary science class that won a national contest. Neat!
        MunInSpaceHigh = You decide to put off writing your report until you reach the dark side of the Mun. There won't be much to see and you'll be able to concentrate better.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Your lab is going through materials at an alarming rate. Perhaps you shouldn't have replaced the entire bottom rack with snacks.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Just another day at the lab... Oh wait, no it isn't! You're flying over the Mun!
        MunInSpaceHigh = Solar radiation reflected off the Mun's surface adds an interesting new angle to your science experiments.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Laboratory work is lots of fun! You can just leave things floating around instead of putting them away!
        MunInSpaceHigh = Zero-gravity experiments are messy! You wish there was sort of space vacuum you can use. Your gaze falls on the airlock and something clicks in your head. Hmm...
        MunInSpaceHigh = Your current experiment spontaneously combusts. Good thing you have more! Now where did we go wrong last time?
        MunInSpaceHigh = Your samples seem to be doing well so far on this journey. You wonder if they are as excited as you are to get to the Mun.
        MunInSpaceHigh = Your experiment involves several high-powered lasers, which never ceases to amuse you.
