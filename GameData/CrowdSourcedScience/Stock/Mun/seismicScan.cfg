    {
        MunSrfLanded = It just detected an impact somewhere on the Mun.
        MunSrfLanded = Nothing to worry about. Really!

        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The Mun appears to be geologically dead. All you can detect are the slight tremors generated by meteorite impacts.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The sensor seems clogged from all the Munar dust. You give up and have a snack.

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = There's an odd signature coming from the crater to the west. You report it to Mission Control, hoping they'll be proud of you.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = The massive impact appears to have created a fault line.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The quakes stop suddenly. You start to get alarmed, then realize you knocked the plug loose.

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The readings here are solid, but they might be better if we could do them in a canyon.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = The readings indicate a massive rockfall nearby.
        MunSrfLandedCanyons = The periodic moon-quakes seem clear and easy to read here. The science team will want to see these numbers.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = The permanently shaded areas in the corners of the craters have slightly less seismic activity than the rest of the Mun.

        MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder how long it would take an impact at the south pole to register at the north pole.

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The scans indicate a large series of quakes incoming! Oh wait, your hand brushed the sensor. False alarm.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = The instrument registers a small anomaly. You aren't sure if this was a genuine seismic event or just a false positive from you shuffling your feet.

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The ground appears to have many small fractures from the multiple impacts, causing slight distortions in readings.

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You carefully place the sensor down on the dusty surface and pat it on the top. 'Now there's a good little sensor.'

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = You set the seismometer down and it promptly tumbles down the embankment to the bottom of the crater. At least it registered something!

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You hope that the geology here will concentrate any minute vibrations from deep within the Mun.
