        MunSrfLandedMidlands = The gravioli curve here is smooth with no anomalies. For once.

        MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The graviolis are strangely non-polar here.

        MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The ship slides a few inches down into the crater as the graviolis swarm around you.

        MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = The graviolis here seem to be 'tilted', whatever that means.

        MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The gravity scans here are normal. Nothing to see here folks, move along.

        MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The graviolis all squish over to the near side of Farside Crater.

        MunSrfLandedCanyons = The data returned by the instrument reveals an ever-so-slight anomaly caused by the Canyons. Or maybe by your box of snacks.

        MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Despite our location the graviolis don't seem to be polarized.

        MunSrfLandedPoles = The graviolis aren't sure whether this is the north or south pole, so they just flow 'down.'

        MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The gravity scan is far less interesting than snacks. You emphatically relay this back to Mission Control.

        MunSrfLandedHighlands = Gravity schmavity. Let's eat some snacks!

        MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The graviolis seem to have a higher velocity towards Scotland here since you're not in the Lowland Craters.

        MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The graviolis seem to be resting at the bottom of the craters. You make a note of this.

        MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = The graviolis are having fun bouncing off the crater walls.

        MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = The graviolis seem to be distributed directly between the two craters.

        //MunSrfLandedLowlands =
        //MunSrfLandedFarsideBasin =

        MunInSpaceLowMidlands = You're not too sure which of the scary-looking numbers (and letters!) on the screen are relevant to your situation. So you just write them all down and send them off to the guys back at KSC.

        MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The scanner is reading a large positive gravitational anomaly while over the Northern Basin.

        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Huh, even this close the Eastern Crater registers the exact same gravity as the Western Crater. Good thing we brought a good map!
        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Perhaps one day this data will be used to model tidal patterns back on Kerbin. Or something like that.
        MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You let the graviolis go to work while you daydream about one day landing in the East Crater below. Or any other spot on the Mun really.

        MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Like the other craters, the Northwest Crater appears to be associated with a large positive gravity anomaly.

        MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = You report a large positive gravitational anomaly over the Southwest Crater. The scientists explain that this is likely due to the basaltic lava flows that filled it in after the impact.

        MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = The graviolis report nominal readings for a crater this size. Maybe the next one will change things up.

        MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The gravity readings fluctuate as you move from canyon to flat ground and back to canyon again.

        MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = The scientists explained that accurate gravitational modelling is critical for ensuring navigation accuracy for future missions. Fine by you, especially if it means getting to go back again.

        MunInSpaceLowPoles = The gravity scanner spits out an impressively long sheet of paper. To your dismay, it's almost entirely filled with numbers.

        MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Your gravity scan yields delicious science while you munch on a delicious snack.

        MunInSpaceLowHighlands = You diligently record the gravitational data low over the Mun's Highlands. Anything that makes landing there easier is fine by you.

        MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = Wow these gravioli particles sure get excited when you activate the scanner.

        MunInSpaceLowMidLandCraters = You are slowly getting an accurate map of gravitational variances across the munar surface. It's not nearly as uniform as you thought it would be.

        MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The gravity fluctuates slightly - but noticeably - as you pass over the crater below.
        MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You try to convince the graviolis that this is indeed an entirely new crater and not at all the same as the last one.

        MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = The gravitational anomalies below don't seem to fit the usual explanation of basaltic lava flows. The scientists at KSC are determined to find an alternative theory.

        //MunInSpaceLowLowlands =
        //MunInSpaceLowFarsideBasin =

        MunInSpaceHighMidlands = Watching the graviolis work is incredibly satisfying even if you aren't too keen on the math involved.

        MunInSpaceHighNorthernBasin = A scientist back at KSC is guiding you through this gravity scan. He seems awfully excited about something called 'mascons'.

        MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = Reading: nominal. It's a crater on the mun, what did you expect?

        MunInSpaceHighNorthwestCrater = Bit by bit, the scientists back at KSC are using your data to build an accurate gravitational model of the Mun.

        MunInSpaceHighSouthwestCrater = The gravity scanner has finished printing a black-and-white model of the Mun's gravity field. It looks rather dull so you take out your crayons and start colouring.

        MunInSpaceHighFarsideCrater = The Mun's low gravity seems ideal for orbital infrastructure. You hope you live long enough to help make that happen.

        MunInSpaceHighCanyons = The gravity signature is quite deep here. You suppose that makes sense.

        MunInSpaceHighPolarCrater = The gravitational anomaly emanated by the huge crater below has actually managed to ever so slightly adjust your orbit.

        MunInSpaceHighPoles = Polar measurement of the Mun's gravitational field? Check! Time for a snack.

        MunInSpaceHighPolarLowlands = The KSC scientists seem particularly interested in gravity readings while over the Mun's poles.

        MunInSpaceHighHighlands = The results are back and... Kerbin's Highlands are still first place! Suck it Mun!

        MunInSpaceHighHighlandCraters = You transmit the data back to KSC. Perhaps they can send you back something useful after they've processed the information.

        MunInSpaceHighMidlandCraters = Your gravity map is showing the Midland Crates as small anomalies from the general background. Could there be a link between the formation of craters and the Mun's gravitational field?

        MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = You wonder what sorts of questions this data will answer back at KSC. Other than "What is the gravity like above the Mun's East Farside Crater?"
        MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = There might be a slight gravitational anomaly here. Or you might just be seeing things and be in dire need of a snack.

        MunInSpaceHighTwinCraters = The Twin Crater's gravitational signature is quite unique. Not surprising considering its unique features.
