        JoolFlyingLow* = The samples are running around in circles.
        JoolFlyingLow* = One of the samples is panicking.
        JoolFlyingLow* = The pressure of the Jool's atmosphere is so high that a few of the samples have begun fusing together.

        JoolFlyingHigh* = Jool's immense gravity is pulling the materials towards one side of the container.

        //JoolInSpaceLow* = Pressured by Jool's gravity, the samples have begun a revouloution. Who they are revoulting against is undeterminable. 

        JoolInSpaceHigh* = We came, we saw, we did science. And we're still here.
