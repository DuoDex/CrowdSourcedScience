        //DunaSrfLanded = Different colored rocks are probably made of different stuff. You should grab as many as you can.
        //DunaSrfLanded = This red dust could be iron oxide, or possibly paprika.
        //DunaSrfLanded = Nope. Not barbecue flavored.
        //DunaSrfLanded = Yup. Dust. Are you surprised?
        //DunaSrfLanded = This sand works well for drawing pictures on your space suit.
        //DunaSrfLanded = You make a note: "Bring laser next time."
        //DunaSrfLanded = Too bad it's only red spice. It would have been much better to go to Eve.
        //DunaSrfLanded = It looks like some sort of spice.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The outer icy crust appears to be made of an unusually dense ice. It gives off wisps of white vapour when held against your warm suit.
	DunaSrfLandedPoles = The ice is a mixture of dry ice and water ice. And those pesky percholorates are all over it.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = On closer inspection, the ice from under the crust appears to have a jumbled hexa-cubic crystal structure rather than the standard tesselating hexagons found on Kerbin.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The exact chemical composition of the surface will no doubt be of interest to the scientists back home.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The winds that girdle the planet have mixed the local grains with dust from all over the surface.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = It appears this soil could be used for snack production, possibly after several centuries of Kerbal-forming.
	DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The soil sample contains percholorates. Time to find a different planet.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = If there is evidence of ancient water here, you ain't finding it. Maybe it's buried too deep.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Digging down a couple of feet, you hit a rocky surface worn smooth by aeons of erosion by the wind.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = It's very thin and fine. You imagine a rover could easily become stuck in this if it had small wheels.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = The surface here is much more solid, darker and less crumbly that other areas on Duna, indicating different localised geology.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = The minerals you manage to chip off the rocks on the crater floor display oddly deformed crystal structures, as though subjected to intense heat and pressure.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = You pick around, searching for a piece of the ancient meteorite that hit here. Instead, you find a piece of your ship hull that you can't quite seem to find where it came from.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You pick up some loose stones that look to have been part of a landslide.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The loose mountain rock you've picked up seems to contain a lot of iron (III) oxide. As such, it's not tasty, nor particularly healthy.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You chip away at the hard basalt with your rock hammer and eventually get a good sample.
	DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The regolith is toxic with high levels of perchlorate compounds.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You dig a little and find a perfectly preserved series of ripple marks from presumably billions of years ago.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The darker ground here is much more compacted than the windblown sediments of elsewhere on Duna, as if laid down and cemented by water.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You start to dig with trepidation at the possibility of finding water before you realise you left your sample container on the ship and have to anticlimatically go and fetch it.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The dust grains here are very large, and feel very rough as you scoop them into a container.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The tough igneous rocks here hamper your attempts to drill a sample. It would be much easier if you had a machine to help.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The local rocks look like breccia and basalt, and contain evidence of significant shocking and fracturing.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = There's a lot of frozen water in this basin, hidden under a thin layer of dust.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = There's a lighter section among the basalt. It looks a bit like limestone. You consider it important and put some of it into your sample container.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Nearby rocks look consistent with flood basalts on Kerbin, suggesting this area was once a giant volcano.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = You don't even have to scoop around for a sample, just hold up a container and it blows right in and collects at the back.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The sand here is much finer from being blown around, and looks to contain traces of tiny polar ice crystals.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = There appears to be traces of water in amongst the fine soil and shifting sand.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The dust here contains traces of ice crystals, the concentrations of which increase with depth. You also find a random, perfectly rounded pebble amongst the sand.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = After an effort to dig a hole, you hit bedrock. It seems to be worn smooth, as if by water rather than dust.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The small rock you pick up seems a variety of alluvial congomerate. You wonder if there was ever a river here.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The surface is mainly deep drifts of dust, so thick and fine that you can't dig deep enough to find solid ground. Dust will have to suffice.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = You find a rare rock outcrop protruding from the dust, which is mostly basaltic and shows signs of extensive faulting.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = You wonder if you need to take a sample considering there is so much dust on you that you could be considered a sample on your own right.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = The dust here appears to be comprised of rock from multiple regions, as suggested by its varying degrees of fineness.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = Lots of dust, but after some digging down you still can't find any bedrock.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You find a nice metal ruler in the sand! You're ready to proclaim the discovery of an alien civilization, but then you find that the one in your suit is missing.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The soil here is like tundra; dirt mixed with ice crystals, with a thin layer of fresh white frost on top.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = You put a sample of the crustal ice in a tube and put it in your pocket. You take it out again shortly afterwards to see a tubeful of vapour bfore the lid pops off in your face.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Collecting a sample of the less dense ice under the crust, you sneak a taste. It's ice all right, if a little off-colour and gritty.
