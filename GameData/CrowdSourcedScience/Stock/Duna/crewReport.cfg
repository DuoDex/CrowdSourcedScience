        //DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = Why did we land here again? There's nothing here but ice in all directions.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = A spiderweb of ice crystals spreads across the pod window as it cools.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Very small piles of fine red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = You look through the thickened glass and see small hills to the horizon.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Dark spots on the surface of Duna were once thought to be the darkness of vegetation growing near the poles as the seasons change. It is now known that the dark coloration is in fact caused by seasonal dust storms.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = A monster dust devil winds its way across the plains in the distance, kicking up a trail of fine dust in its wake.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = Duna's surface seems to be covered with dunes. You remark that the planet was aptly-named.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = You look out and see the crater floor filled with sand sculpted into patterns by the wind currents.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = "It's extremely red; over."
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = I spy with my little eye something beginning with "h".. yes, it's "hill".
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You write down 'red', 'bouldered', and 'dusty' in the logbook.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The gentle winds on the lowland plains deposit a fine coating of dust on the window, turning the world even redder.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = "Goooood morning ladies and gentlekerbs, the weather outlook for today features highs of a nippy -5 degrees with the dust storm hazard level at medium-high. If you're going out, be sure to bundle up warm and always carry a respirator. This is Jeb, for KSWN."

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The red landscape outside the window doesn't look particularly inviting. Do you have to go out there?
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Sand starts to pile up on the window ledge. That's right, sand! Not dust for once!

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ice is slowly creeping over the ancient lava field. You hope it doesn't creep over you, too.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = One side of the basin is mostly ice, the other is mostly rock. You check the map to see which side you landed on.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = You squint through the dust-are those mountains off in the distance? ...Those aren't mountains-they're canyon walls!
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = With the craft now still, the red Dunaian sand starts to pile up on the window. You try to tap the window to knock it off, until a wind gust does that for you.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The canyon walls here look...curvy. Odd.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The chasm looks ominous from down here, like any self-respecting canyon should.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The canyon is so huge and dusty you can't see the other wall. It makes you feel perticularly small. Well... OK, stop rubbing it in, Duna!
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The air is thick with dust down here, and the haze reduces visibility to a couple of hundred metres or so.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = This canyon looks pretty narrow and relatively dust free, letting you get a clear view of the walls.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You imagine the canyon as a groove in a giant, red vinyl record. Actually, maybe music-loving aliens built this?

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = You look out and see a network of tunnels running beneath the ice to a nearby hole, and try not to think about what this says about the ice.
        DunaSrfLandedPoalrHighlands = The craft briefly slides and judders over the ice before coming to a stop. It takes a while to let go of the grip handles.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = You look out at the vast icy bowl in the landscape and dearly hope the EVA suits are climate controlled.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The cabin radiator clicks on, dispelling the cold seeping into the craft.

        //DunaFlyingLow = You really like Duna. It reminds you of chocolate pancakes.

        DunaFlyingLowPoles = A scattering of tiny ice crystals flows past the window like dust particles.
        DunaFlyingLowPoles = The pod window is cold to the touch. Better hope there's some mittens in the cupboard.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The low red hills start to blend into one another in the distance. You rub your eyes.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The planet looks very red, which reminds you of the red chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?

        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = The plains below are criscrossed with lines of disturbed sand, like sand-based crazy paving.
        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = You gaze at the planet, and realize you'll have no problems keeping your night vision.

        DunaFlyingLowCraters = You shiver in your seat. Your thoughts turn to the glowing warmth of re-entry into Kerbin's atmosphere and you start to miss your family.
        DunaFlyingLowCraters = You see the crater walls looming imposingly off in the distance. Whatver made this, it must have been a big ol' wallop.

        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light... No, no... that's a face.
        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = You can get a good enough vantage point at the surface, why bother with coming up that little bit higher?

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = You spot a towering column of dust far off in the distance. Wonder what that could be?
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = There's a monster dust storm bearing down on your landing spot. Might not want to spend too much time there.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The smell of the snacks you put on to warm up earlier starts to make you hungry at a bad time.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = In the low Duna gravity, things fly further. You know that because you just got hit in the face by a boot thrown at you by turbulence.

        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = A sudden gust of freezing wind almost blows the ship off course. Such are the hazards of being near the icy zones.
        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = You want to do a barrel roll, until you realise KSC is closely monitoring all craft telemetry and you'd rather keep your job when you return.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = The huge scar scraped out of the surface stretches all the way to the reddish, hazy horizon.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = A powerful gust of wind shakes the capsule violently and a long-forgotten snack falls out of the overhead locker.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = This one will take some landing skill. You try to pick out a spot that isn't too steeply sloping.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = You can't see much more from here, as the canyon curves out of your view.

        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = There's so much dust you can barely see the ground. You're flying blind with only the altimeter to tell you of the nearby ground.
        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The dust clouds roil past the window, as though the very air is alive with sand.

        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = You look down, and hope you don't land on one of the steep walls. That would be... problematic.
        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The canyon stretches off to the hazy horizon in both directions. You feel like you've said something similar before.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = The icy hills stretch out in all directions beneath you. The ice glare makes it difficult to look down.
        DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = You find a page in the safety manual on how to deal with space polar bear attacks. Unfortunately, all it says is "run away".

        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = All you can see is pinkish ice to the horizon, albeit lacking the dust haze of the lower latitudes.
        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = You fumble around the glovebox for a pair of sunglasses to protect from the ice glare, which is strong even in the weak Dunaian sun.

        DunaFlyingHigh = There seems to be something resembling a face on the surface of a planet, but it's only a play of light and shadow.
        DunaFlyingHigh = The faint whistle of the the thin air around the capsule is almost relaxing.
        DunaFlyingHigh = You look outside to try and spot Duna's version of the "thin blue line", but there is none to be seen.

        DunaInSpaceLow = Can it be Kerbiformed?
        DunaInSpaceLow = Duna. Kerbin's small, failed twin. The thought of what it could have been makes you sad.
        DunaInSpaceLow = As you orbit the planet, you pick up what appears to be a TV signal from Kerbin. It's so badly distorted that you can't make neither head nor tail of it.

        DunaInSpaceHigh = The crew is concerned that the planet is "too red". Mission Control does not believe this is a good reason to go home.
        DunaInSpaceHigh = Hopefully wherever you are is out of the grasping graviational claws of Ike.
        DunaInSpaceHigh = Is it a big tomato?
