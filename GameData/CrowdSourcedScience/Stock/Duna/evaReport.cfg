        //DunaSrfLanded = You see red. A LOT of red.
        //DunaSrfLanded = The air is a little thin up here. Down here?
        //DunaSrfLanded = Would this be a good place to have giant sand worms for pets?
        //DunaSrfLanded = A gust of wind creates a small red dust storm, it's hard to see.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = It feels as though a stiff breeze is tugging at your ankles. You suspect that this means gas is escaping from the ice caps, and this makes you slightly nervous.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = A sudden puff of gas makes you jump back from the geyser hole you were peering into.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = I'm hungry. Where's my pizza? What do you mean, you have a 37,000-Fund charge for Duna doorstep delivery? 300 days or it's free!
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = It looks boring out here. You flip your sun visor down and up again as if it might make it more interesting.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Duna's low gravity would lend itself well to an exciting game of basketball! You consider adding a hoop to your next lander design.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = You feel like a true hero as you march across the red planet, until you realize you're a long, long way from home.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The sand here is much too fine to make a sandcastle with so you decide to bound around for a bit. Mission Control orders you back to your tasks-you've come all this way, why can't you just have a few minutes of FUN!?

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = You've proven the alien conspiracy theorists wrong. There are no tall, pink men anywhere to be seen.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = You can't see the edges of the crater from the ground. Are you sure this is even a crater?

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = There's no wind. The slight force that buffets you around everywhere else is unnervingly absent.
	DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Hills, schmills, I'm on top of the world up here! I can see forever!

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You look up at Ike overhead, and it reminds you of Dres. It's just as dull, too.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You trudge on through the fine red sand, dust cascading off your boots with every step.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = You can't see the other side of the basin. Whatever sort of basin it is, it's massive!
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Your suit does a pretty good job of keeping you warm in the cold, but your toes are getting a bit chilly.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ground is slushy underfoot, as though it can't make its mind up over whether it wants to be ice or rock.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = A squall of freezing wind blows off the ice cap, briefly making you very cold indeed.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = A blast of howling wind almost blows you off your feet as sand clatters against your visor plate.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The even-more-freezing-than-usual wind bites into your toes. Where could it possibly be coming from?
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The sand grains flying past swirl and rub against each other as an even more huge dust storm front bears down on you from the north. The air around you crackles with static electricity that makes your hair stand up.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = On one side you can see rock face, on the other you can see the vast expanse of the Midland Sea.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = You look up at the walls, but lose your balance and tip over, landing on your back in the dust.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = You want to stand on a rock and strike a dramatic pose, but you can't find a big enough one in the thick haze.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = Dust-that's all you can see. You daren't wander too far from the ship in case you can't find it again.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You look down one end of the canyon, and then look down the other end. It's very disorienting, and you'd hate to get lost here.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You pull out a pair of binoculars and look at the wall just in time to see a huge boulder fall from the precipice and crash to the canyon floor. The sound doesn't make it to your position.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = From this elevated vantage point you can see the dazzling pinkish hills stretching into the distance.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = You look back at your ship and see large amounts of vapour hissing from under it. You hope it isn't about to sink into the ice.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = You step onto the ice and immediately almost slip over. Some things never change about ice.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Thankfully, the suits have climate control. You try and stop yourself thinking about you freezing your ass off without it.

        DunaFlyingLowPoles = You see a far-off gas plume eject a large chunk of ice into the thin air. You consider jumping into one to see how high you can get.
        DunaFlyingLowPoles = Everywhere you look, you see white. The undulating icy plains stretch toward the steeply curving horizon.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlands = For a moment, you think you catch a glimpse of a small, shiny, black-topped object in the distance. Then it's gone.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlands = Up here, the dust seems a lot thinner. Until you see a dust storm rolling in off the lowlands from your vantage point.

        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = The featureless plains stretch off into the distance. It's too cold here for any mirages.
        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = Even off the ground, the air is strangely calm. It's still really cold though, and that snaps you out of your feeling of unease.

        DunaFlyingLowCraters = OK, from up here you can see the edges of this vast bowl in the landscape. You feel small.
        DunaFlyingLowCraters = Even down here the thin Dunaian atmosphere is too tenuous to slow you down much.

        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = There's not enough atmosphere to slow you down much up here, you'll have to use your jets unless you like faceplanting.
        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = The dust seems to be dyeing your suit and you're sure you'll be the laughing stock of the whole KSC when you return in pink.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Airborne sand grains skitter off your visor glass, creating an almost hypnotic hissing noise.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Despite moving at some speed through the air, you don't feel any kind of substantial wind resistance. The atmosphere must be extremely thin.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The wind tries its best to buffet you around, but you manage to stay steady and get a look around from a slightly higher vantage point.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The wind blowing around you is cold. Like, really cold. You long for the warmth of your seat on the ship.

        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = You distract yourself from the effects of the rushing cold air by imagining sitting back in the Astronaut Complex breakroom with a cup of warm koffee and a biscuit.
        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = It's even colder than usual up here at these high latitudes, and the wind chill from flying makes it even colder. You hope the airheads at the AC fixed your suit heater before you left.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = You struggle to maintain your aerial position in the winds and consider tying yourself to the craft.
        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = There is an eerie lull in the weather, and for a few seconds the dust clears enough for you to marvel at the canyon's vast scale.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = The sun is shining, but it's still cold here. Cold enough to make you wish you had brought some hot koffee with you.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = You're in the air but thanks to the looming walls, you don't feel like you're getting any higher or lower.

        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The dust is still thick, but does thin out a little when off the surface. Still can't see much, though.
        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = You look down, and try to make out patterns in the swirling dust. That's a... swirly thing. That's another swirly thing.

        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = From up here you can see both walls. Quite the narrow canyon indeed; perfect for some high-speed hovering-craft racing!
        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The straightness of the walls you can see makes your eyes start to water.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = It looks much the same from up here as it does down there. Hilly and white.
	DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = The peaks are covered in ice, but as far as you can tell there are no glaciers to be found.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = From the air, you can clearly see the shape of the icy depression. Quite a large hole indeed.
        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = The hope you had of being able to have a snowball fight fade as you see it's all ice down there.

        DunaFlyingHigh = Luckily the Dunaian atmosphere is very thin. Otherwise you and your craft would get separated very quickly pulling a stunt like this.
        DunaFlyingHigh = Even though the drag force is very low, you feel like you should really get back in.
	DunaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere is thin at best at the surface, and all the way up here you barely feel any aero forces or drag.

        DunaInSpaceLowPoles = The curving edge of the planet shows just a hint of red surrounding a sea of white ice below you. It's beautiful!
        DunaInSpaceLowPoles = The mountain chains are just visible as a series of wiggly lines stretching over the sea of white.

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = You mentally trace the lines of the ancient valleys in the landscape. Former rivers, maybe?
        DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = The squiggly patterns in the land below are so mesmerising it takes a snappy comment from Mission Control to bring you back.

        DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = It looks boring down there. Even the Midlands might be a more interesting place to land.
        DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = A dust storm front moves lazily across the flatlands, obscuring the surface behind it.

        DunaInSpaceLowCraters = Even from here you can see the outline of the craters. You feel glad Kerbin only has one of these great holes.
        DunaInSpaceLowCraters = You try to get a good look, but a glint of sunlight off the ice caps has you attempting to rub your eyes through your visor.

        DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = Them's some big mountains. You wonder if there's gold in them there hills too.
	DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = It's difficult to tell where the Highlands end and the Midlands begin. All of Duna looks the same after a while.

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = You look down, and try to imagine the Midland Sea when it was still full of water. It's hard, given the state of the place now.
        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = The surface in the depression looks darker and the edges are clearly visible, especially in the great semicircular scar in the north.

        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = From here, you can see the basin, with the huge rebound peak in the centre giving it away as a crater. It's enormous!
        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The huge basin below looks like a doughnut, to compliment the koffee stain canyon to the east.

        DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = It's easy to track the edges of the basin on the land, but where it disappears under the ice it's hard to make them out.
        DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = The depression is just about visible running under the ice as a darkened patch of lower elevation

        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = That's a big scar. Duna must have been in a serious fight at some point.
        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The waves of airborne sand blowing through the canyon below form beautiful patterns over the surface.

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = You trace the outline of the canyon in front of you. It reminds you of a koffee stain.
        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = It looks like someone had their koffee cup on the surface or tried to saw through the crust. Either way, it's impressive.

        DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = This canyon is by far the biggest of Duna's great scars, slicing through plains and hills alike.
        DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = If you tilt your head sideways, you could swear the canyon looks like a crooked smiley face. What do you mean, 'you're seeing things'?

        DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = The great scar in the landscape below links two of the biggest basins on Duna like some kind of great cutting.
        DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = Zooming in, you see half a crater on the edge of the canyon. Was it made by half a meteorite, or has the rest fallen into the canyon as it widened?

        DunaInSpaceLowPolarHighlands = The icy hills glint in the sunlight far below you. You wonder if there are any UFOs buried down there.

        DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = It's white, and it looks cold down there. If you're going down there, you should probably go and search for some warm gloves.
        DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = The crater appears as a dark dot set against the slightly pinkish whiteness of the polar ice cap.

        DunaInSpaceHigh = No matter which way you look, that big, red eye is always reflected in the corner of your visor.
        DunaInSpaceHigh = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's colours encompass white, red, orange and brown. Definitely needs more blue and green.
