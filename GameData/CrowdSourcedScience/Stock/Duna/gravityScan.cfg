        //DunaSrfLanded = The gravity is high enough to walk normally but low enough for EVA packs to work like jet-packs. Colonizing here just got a lot more appealing.
        //DunaSrfLanded = The tidal effects of Ike seem to get less and less as you move away from its geostationary spot.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = A burst of gas from underneath jolts the ship, and you have to reset the detector.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The sensor refuses to work, citing 'FOREIGN CONTAMINANT'. You sigh, knowing you have to clean it out again.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Seems pretty normal aside from Ike's libration causing slight tides.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The lands here produce no significant deviations from the Duna mean aside from a very slight lowering of gravity strength.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Beep, boop. Beep, boop. Beep, boop. The noises of the sensor are more interesting than the results.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = Surface measurements of the gravitational anomaly that exists here allow precise measuring of its effect on Duna's internal structure.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = While you wait for the gravimeter to finish its scanning, a rock rolls downhill and bounces off the window with a crack to remind you you're on a slope.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Gravity here is slightly higher than elsewhere but less than expected.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You leave the scanner to do its thing and try not to worry about the dust ruining an 8,800-Fund piece of science kit.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The net gravity strength here varies ever so slightly with Ike's libration pattern.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = All the while the sensor is running, you find yourself hoping aloud that the sand stays out of it. The warranty was voided long ago, and gravimeters are expensive!

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The detector doesn't pick up much out of the ordinary.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ice cap in the south distorts the gravity here slightly, and the basin itself shows the signatures of volcanic activity.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The sensor attempts to measure the gravity through the craft's shaking in the winds. Eventally, it gives up and asks for a shock absorber.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The wind drops for long enough to allow the meter to complete its readings. Gravity looks to be ever so slightly lower here, but internal structure is the same.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Looks like standard crustal patterns here. Whatever made this canyon wasn't anything tectonic.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = That's a big bump on the Kouguer graph, which suggests significant crustal thinning is present in the area.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = The lack of any gravimetric anomalies here and the proximity to an ex-sea suggests this valley was carved by water or other erosional processes.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Picking up a Kerbin-sized hunk of ice is easy. If you entered a strongkerbal contest remotely, you would win gold!

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = While the detector does its thing, you distract yourself with a view of the pretty white landscape.

        DunaInSpaceLowPoles = There doesn't seem to be any gravity here. You grab a towel that is floating by and stow it away.

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = The gravimeter reading dips ever so slightly whenever you pass over one of the snaking valleys.
        DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = No anomalies here, just the perfect region for Dunaian interior mapping.

        DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = Down here, orbital coverage is relatively HD, yet still no anomalies show their heads. Keep looking.
        DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = Even KSC gets bored with the lack of anything happening and orders you to scan somewhere else.

        DunaInSpaceLowCraters = Gravitational field strength dips noticeably as you pass over the crater. Surface measurements would let us nail down evem more detailed readings.
        DunaInSpaceLowCraters = You don't see the normal crustal shock signatures found at Kerbin's own crater, suggesting Duna has a different internal structure.

        DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = The line on the readout jitters around as you pass over huge massifs and valleys.
        DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = Graphical output shows a classic crustal thickening pattern, but less pronounced that otherwise thought. Maybe Duna's crust is thick enough not to form mountain roots?

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = A dip as the elevation drops, and a bump as it rises. Nothing special, really.
        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = Readings spew from the device onto the monitor as a wavy line, but not really that wavy.

        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = Overall gravity strength forms a W-shaped graph thanks to the presence of the rebound peak.

        DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = Not too exciting. There's a tiny dip in overall strength, the Kouguer wave shows a bump as if the crust was thinner here.

        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The local gravity strength dips extremely noticeably (well, relatively speaking) as you pass over the huge chasm.
        DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The various gravimetric lines go crazy, probably related to the giant canyon below. You didn't need this fancy kit to spot it.

        DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = No major variations are detected, aside from a tiny drop in overall gravity as you pass over the valley.

        DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = Readings scroll across the screen, and when you pass over the canyon gravity drops slightly while the Kouguer reading spikes.

        DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = The needle dips slightly as you pass over the chasm, but there are no significant tectonic-associated changes.

        DunaInSpaceLowPolarHighlands = Slight variations in gravity hint at the presence of entire moutains buried deep within the ice.

        DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = The size of the blip created by the depression is too large for the ice alone, the crater must extend into the rock deep below.

        DunaInSpaceHighPoles = The ice far below doesn't seem to affect the gravity much. Try getting closer.

        DunaInSpaceHighMidlands = The Midlands' signal is drowned out by gravimetric noise from the surrounding highlands and canyons.
        DunaInSpaceHighMidlands = Even safely out of its reach, Ike still manages to be annoying and mess with your readings.

        DunaInSpaceHighLowlands = All you're getting is the noise from nearby mountain ranges. Hopefully we'll find something once we get closer.
        DunaInSpaceHighLowlands = The sensor must be in the wrong way, because it's giving you some beautiful data on the Duna-Ike gravitational relationship but nothing from Duna.

        DunaInSpaceHighCraters = Readings point teasingly at the presence of a gravimetric anomaly, but you can't isolate it at this altitude.
        DunaInSpaceHighCraters = You're eating a snack when the display suddenly gives its loud 'anomaly bleep'. You give the console a smack for its trouble.

        DunaInSpaceHighHighlands = The gravimeter ticks up slightly when passing over the mountain belts.
        DunaInSpaceHighHighlands = Did one of those floating magic boulders fly past? Because something just spiked the gravioli count!

        DunaInSpaceHighMidlandSea = You bash the monitor, as the line isn't moving. It still doesn't move.
        DunaInSpaceHighMidlandSea = The readings slowly collate into a gravimetric map of... one single colour, with a dip thanks to Ike in the middle.

        DunaInSpaceHighNorthernBasin = Not much. There are two small dips from passing over the basin, maybe a lower-altitude observation will reveal more?

        DunaInSpaceHighSouthernBasin = Getting a lot of interference from the ice caps and Ike, but there looks to be some small anomalies.

        DunaInSpaceHighNorthernShelf = Even from high orbit, the effects of the canyon appear clearly on the readout.
        DunaInSpaceHighNorthernShelf = "Pilot! Follow that anomaly!". Huehuehue. Always wanted to say that.

        DunaInSpaceHighMidlandCanyon = Ike's influence is especially strong here (it's right overhead), making it very hard to conduct precise measurements of the ground.

        DunaInSpaceHighEasternCanyon = While the machine beeps and whirrs doing its thing, you invent the new sport of zero-G wall tennis with a crumpled page from a safety manual as the ball and a book as the bat.

        DunaInSpaceHighWesternCanyon = Whatever impact that canyon has, it must be pretty small as you aren't getting much from way up here.

        DunaInSpaceHighPolarHighlands = Doing a cartwheel takes no effort. You accidentally hit a switch while spinning, hopefully it didn't do anything.

        DunaInSpaceHighPolarCraters = From up here you can get a gravimetric image of the whole area, with the crater clearly visible as an area of lower gravity.
