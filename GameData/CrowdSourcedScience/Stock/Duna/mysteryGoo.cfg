        //DunaSrfLanded* = The Goo has gotten red dust all over itself.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles* = The Goo shrinks from the openings in its container and sticks to the shadows at the back. Maybe it's dazzled by the ice too?

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = The Goo seems to have spattered about the container during the landing.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = The Goo looks bored, as it requesting to be taken to a more interesting part of Duna.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands* = The strong winds from a passing dust devil ripple the exposed Goo. You think it's enjoying it.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = The Goo rocks from side to side, as though on a boat (or, in this case, a ship).
        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = The Goo begins to faintly glow and almost crackles with energy. It seems to be energised by this place.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = Here the Goo is turning red and angry.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = The Goo adjusts itself on the slope so it is always level.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea* = The Goo looks bored here. So are you.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = The Goo arranges itself into a ring-shaped blob.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin* = The Goo looks to be shivering, and has gone pink.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = The Goo looks to be cowering in a corner of its container. Maybe it's unsettled by the wind as well.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = The Goo must have battened down the hatches and hid, since there's no sign of it.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = The Goo goes as red as the ground.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = The Goo puts on a helmet. You wonder why.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = The Goo turns as red as the surrounding dust clouds.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = The Goo looks to be wearing a facemask. How it got in there is a mystery (it's not called 'mystery' for nothing), but it sure knows its priorities.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon* = The Goo turns a reddish colour, like it has everywhere else.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon* = The Goo looks impressed with something.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = The Goo slowly rotates, catching what little dust is in the air at these latitudes.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = The Goo staunchly avoids one side of the container. Did we pick the wrong pole?

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters* = The Goo turns the same colour as the ice.

        DunaFlyingLow* = The red color excites The Goo.

        DunaFlyingHigh* = The Goo looks longingly homeward. At least, you think that's what it's doing.

        DunaInSpaceLow* = The Goo has split into lots of little Goos. They appear to be voting on a leader.
        DunaInSpaceLow* = The Goo likes it here. It's like a second home for The Goo!

        DunaInSpaceHigh* = The Goo is forming into geometric shapes! Sphere, pyramid, cube, diamond... Is that a face? It's your face!
