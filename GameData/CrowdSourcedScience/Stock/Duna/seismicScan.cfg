        //DunaSrfLanded = The planet doesn't seem to have much seismic activity.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The seismic scan picks up some vibrations as gas vents from the ice cap underneath.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The scan detects some activity, probably associated with melting of the polar cap.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The readings indicate a solid iron core. This planet might have had a functioning geodynamo in the distant past before its core fully cooled.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = A refracted ping is recieved from an antipodal mountain. This reveals a still partially-molten interior. Could the mountain be a dormant volcano?

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The instrument detects some very faint tremors. Maybe Duna isn't so dead after all?
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Nothing. Zilch. Nada. The only vibrations have come from you dropping a snack.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = Not much interesting happens when you run the seismic scan. Maybe the planet is geologically dead, or perhaps it is just having a nap.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = The ground is still and silent, like everywhere else on this freezing rustball. You wonder what the impact would have felt like.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The seismograph barely responds. If this planet ever had seismic activity, it doesn't any more.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Tiny vibrations from skittering rocks on the surface are all that show up on the equipment.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The libration of Ike overhead generates almost undetectable tremors from ground movement akin to tides.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The entire planet looks to have flatlined, or at least the seismograph has.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Pings sent down into the bedrock are scattered and refracted in all directions, indicating the presence of extensive rock faulting and fracturing.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = There's no detectable activity here, which means no active tectonics in the area.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Cracking and shifting ice in the basin creates some weak, shallow waves.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The sparse seismic activity seems to peak during the day, as though the nearby ice melting is resposible for shockwaves.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The wind rattles the seismometer so much it's impossible to get a reading. Apparently, this is a magnitude VI dunaquake, if such a thing exists.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = In amongst all the vibration noise, the meter picks up a tiny rumble from deep beneath the ground. Could this place be a relic of an ancient fault line?

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The ground is perfectly still here, save for some vanishingly faint pings from the other side of the planet.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Ike's libration overhead generates regular swarms of tiny movements in the crust.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = What's that? Did everyone feel that? The seismometer certainly did, and we appear to have landed in a rift valley zone.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = After a while, the sensor has detected no less than eleven small quakes. Duna is still active after all!

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = Not a peep. Either Duna is dozing, or it really is seismially dead.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = Discouraged, you leave the sensor running for some time. When you return, the only vibrations are from your feet and the wind.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The scattering of seismic pings sent down suggests the presence of multiple ice layers and rock far below.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Your scan records a few small tremors. Hopefully there are no Duna dinosaurs.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The detector picks up the vibrations of ice cracking and shifting beneath the ship. It's quite disconcerting.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Not much, apart from some ice noises. Either Duna is seismically dead or ice is a good shock absorber.
