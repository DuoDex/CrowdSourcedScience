        //DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The air is cold. The atmosphere must not support a strong greenhouse effect.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Duna is awfully cold for being so red. Not on fire, then.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Duna is colder than you expected.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = It's even colder here than everywhere else at night.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = You wouldn't know it by looking, but it's actually really cold out here.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = The landscape sink means the crater floor is cold. And that's Duna-brand cold.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The thin air is colder than anything you'd find on Kerbin.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = If the thermometer liquid wasn't in a pressurised tube, it'd freeze solid.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You thought of desert worlds as hot, not places to freeze your everything off.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = Another cold day on Duna. Holidaying on the shores of the Great Western Desert seems very far away now.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Coldness is taken as a given on Duna, and this place is no exception. It's freezing.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The slushy ice-dust mixture found here cakes to the thermometer, insulating it from the wind.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = It's Duna, it's cold and it's even colder with the wind chill. What a surprise...and now the thermometer's blown away.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = These winds blow straight off the polar ice cap, bringing with them a savagely biting icy chill.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = A gentle breeze starts up, and even that is enough to drop the temperature and remind you of how cold it is.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The sun breaks through the thick haze, warming the thermometer enough for it to defrost and the gauge to become clearly visible again.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The cold sink nature of the canyon makes this place even more bitingly cold at nights.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = This canyon doesn't seem as cold as one would expect given its cold sink status.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = It's warmer than expected in here. Either it's radiation off the walls or lack of much wind chill.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Temperatures range between bitterly cold and cold enough to freeze the very air solid.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Temperatures fluctuate wildly as the sun changes position in the sky. The depression must act as a cold sink.

        //DunaFlyingLow = It's cold enough as it is, and the wind chill from flying through the air makes it even colder.

        DunaFlyingLowPoles = You wish you could drink a cup of hot chocolate, but you can't take your helmet off. The thermometer seems to be frozen solid.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlands = Rotating the thermometer to face the sun gives a noticeable temperature increase.

        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = You wonder if the wind chill from flying here would be cold enough to freeze the ethanol in the thermometer. Sadly, no.
        DunaFlyingLowLowlands = Temperatures increase as you drop. But not much.

        DunaFlyingLowCraters = Enough ice flakes off the thermometer display to see the reading spell 'COLD'

        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = The air is far too thin to conduct much heat away from the device.
        DunaFlyingLowHighlands = Rotating the thermometer away from the sun freezes the liquid, towards the sun warms it too much. Gah!

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Temperatures drop when the wind picks up. Drop more, that is.
        DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = A dust haze drifts in front of Kerbol, and it gets just that little bit colder.

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = Temperatures decrease noticeably near the basin floor, indicating the presence of a layer of cold air.

        DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = Well done, Kerlock. You figured out that Duna is cold. Woot!

        DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = That little bit of altitude doesn't protect you from the icy canyon wind.

        DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = The thermometer has a bubble in it, so you gently tap it and end up making even more bubbles.

        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = Above the dust, you can finally see the effect sunlight has on the temperature, as though the craft is basking in the feeble warmth.
        DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The sinking cold air is below you up here, and mixes with slightly warmer air from other zones.

        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The thicker air here wicks away heat from the thermometer more effectively than elsewhere.
        DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The canyon walls are channelling warmer air from the Midland Sea to the south, but at a relatively slow wind speed.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = A gust of even colder air buffets the craft. The temperature drops by another few degrees.

        DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = The thermometer is encrusted with ice, obscuring the display. You note down "cold" as a substitute.

        DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
        DunaFlyingHigh = Turning up the thermostat in your climate controlled suit does little to keep the cold from creeping into your toes.

        DunaInSpaceLow = Duna is cold, so thermal back radiation at night is limited. It's definitely there, though.
        DunaInSpaceLow = You hope the atmosphere provides a bit more insulation at the surface than you get in space.

        DunaInSpaceHigh = As expected, it's cold at Duna's distance from Kerbol. By extension, Duna is cold as well.
        DunaInSpaceHigh = The gauge on the thermometer sticks, so you give it a few taps. It drops another few degrees.
