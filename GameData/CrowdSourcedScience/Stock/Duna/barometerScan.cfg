        //DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
        //DunaSrfLanded = There isn't much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.

        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = The atmosphere is slightly denser due to the gases escaping the ice beneath.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles = A blast of pressure from a nearby gas geyser is detected.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = There's air here, but not much of it.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The pressure here is average and seems to consist of mostly dust.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters = The lower altitude of the craters results in slightly higher than average pressures.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters = There's just enough air here to fill a parachute, but don't even think about trying to breathe it.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Duna's air is thin normally, and it's even thinner here on the mountaintops.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = We just broke the Duna pressure record for this spot! Well, the record was "N/A" before now.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The unusually high pressure drops ever so slightly as a dust vortex passes over the craft.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The atmosphere is a bit denser here from the low altitude.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Diurnal pressure variations are smaller than expected, possibly thanks to the canyon outlet to the south.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The atmospheric pressure is largely average save for occasional gusts sweeping in off the ice.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Atmospheric pressure here shows larger diurnal fluctuations than elsewhere due to its proximity to the ice cap.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = Low altitude makes the air a bit more dense here. Just a bit.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = Winds howling through the canyon from the north generate regular pressure spikes.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The altitude here is very low, so the atmosphere is pretty thick (for Duna).
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Pressure here shows less diurnal variation than other places on Duna.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = There's more air here, but even more dust. That's not good news for the barometer you've already cleaned out twice today.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = Air pressure increases substantially at night here as the atmosphere cools and sinks.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = There's a little bit more gas down here than some other places.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = Wanting to have something to report, you tap the barometer and the needle rises slightly. Result!

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Atmospheric pressure seems to experience measurable diurnal fluctuations.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The air here is pretty dense and pressure is higher thanks to the cold temperatures.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Pressure increases greatly as the temperature drops at nights and cold, dense air sinks into the depression.

        DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
        DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it's still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
        DunaFlyingLow = Not much pressure, and even less when flying at altitude.

        DunaFlyingHigh = Even the barometer isn't sure how to interpret the readings.
        DunaFlyingHigh = There's some gas up here, but not much. What little pressure there is remains far below.
        DunaFlyingHigh = Pressure reads: "Gasping for air". You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.

        DunaInSpaceLow = You're pretty sure this is a vacuum, but given how thin the atmosphere is you can't really be sure.
        DunaInSpaceLow = You're the one under pressure here, not the barometer. It quite clearly shows.

        DunaInSpaceHigh = The surface all the way down there must surely have more atmosphere than up here.
        DunaInSpaceHigh = There's probably a few atoms out there, but you can't detect them with a simple barometer.
