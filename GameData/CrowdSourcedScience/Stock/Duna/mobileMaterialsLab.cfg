        DunaSrfLanded* = The samples appear to be permanently red. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
        DunaSrfLanded* = The samples are slowly turning red. Or is that just your eyesight?

        DunaSrfLandedPoles* = Nothing much happens to the samples when exposed to geyser gas. Whataver it is, it muct be pretty inert.
        DunaSrfLandedPoles* = You suddenly remember you left the bottle of whisky you smuggled on board disguised as a sample in the chamber. As you watch, ice encrusts the side of the bottle, but the alcohol stays liquid. Who knew liquor could be a science experiment?

        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = The thin atmosphere of Duna evidently isn't too thin, since it blows several of the samples out of the chamber.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlands* = An arc lamp in the bay blows out, and the resulting white-hot sparks cause the aluminium sample to react with dust in the chamber, throwing off an impressive amount of fire to produce a kind of white ash.

        DunaSrfLandedLowlands* = The fine lowlands dust worms its way into everything. Even behind the lens of the observation camera.
        DunaSrfLandedLowlands* = The samples haven't changed since you last looked at them. Not even the slightly thicker air and fine dust can change them.

        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = Observing becomes somewhat difficult as red dust cakes over the camera lens.
        DunaSrfLandedCraters* = You half-hoped to see the bolide fragment do something interesting after coming here. Sadly, it doesn't.

        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = There's not enough wind here to disturb the samples, and the thin air doesn't affect then either.
        DunaSrfLandedHighlands* = Dust has gotten into the door mechanism, and you thump it to make it open. Fat lot of change you get, anyway.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea* = You put a small sample of subsurface sand into the chamber, and hear a series of tiny pops from the sodium as you heat it. Interesting.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea* = You lost a few of the test samples in transit, but that's not really an issue as they all just turn red anyway.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = The coarse dust doesn't penetrate as far into everything as the standard insidious stuff you find on Duna.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin* = You leave the samples to do their thing, and go fetch the snacks you warmed earlier.

        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin* = The mixture of ice and dust cakes the samples. Nothing happens, apart from them going pink.
        DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin* = It's cold here. Suffice to say, all the samples freeze.

        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = You open the doors, and the wind immediately sweeps every single sample out of the bay. Damn.
        DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf* = Run the experiment if you want, but the bay camera has been sandblasted to pieces and I am NOT going out there to look.

        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = A sudden, unexpected gust of wind knocks several samples out of the chamber, but you're more concerned about the spacesuits turning pink.
        DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon* = Sand piles up in drifts against the samples. It's pretty fine, so you bash the chamber and it all cascades out onto the ground.

        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = The samples quickly disappear under a thick caking of dust. True to form, the observation computer attracts the most.
        DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon* = The doors grind open with the sort of crunching sound made by large quantities of dust in the servo mechanism.

        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon* = You get the standard Duna reaction from most is the samples (i.e. going slightly red and cold). However, you put one of the lithium hydroxide CO2 scrubbers from the capsule into the bay as an afterthought, and watch it form a white, powdery coating.
        DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon* = The dust that blows into the bay appears to be from two sources, as it forms two different piles of fine and grainier sand.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = Most of the samples crystallise and the white samples look even whiter. Maybe with a pink hue.
        DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands* = You notice tiny beads of mercury condensing on the inside surface of the bay's striplight and hurriedly turn it back on to keep it warm.

        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters* = Ice cascades off the sample bay doors as they open, and it's more interesting than what happens to the samples (they get cold, and that's it).
        DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters* = Following exposure, most of the liquid samples freeze while a few boil instead. The solid ones do very little.

        DunaFlyingLow* = The atmosphere whips most of the samples of the bay immediately. Seems you underestimated it.
        DunaFlyingLow* = There's a fizzling sound as the dust shorts something out in the bay mechanism. It comes back online after a few shakes and presses.

        DunaFlyingHigh* = Some of the lighter samples still shift around in the rushing high-altitude air.
        DunaFlyingHigh* = The upper atmosphere is too rarefied and thin to react with anything other than pushing stuff about.

        DunaInSpaceLow* = A thruster jolt must have disturbed one of the samples, since it's currently all over the wall.
        DunaInSpaceLow* = The samples haven't done much in space, but what they do on the surface must be very interesting.

        DunaInSpaceHigh* = The radiation on the journey here has bleached some of the samples, and polymers have turned brittle.
        DunaInSpaceHigh* = Normal spacey stuff has happened to the samples. Yes, that's what we call it.
