        DresSrfLanded* = Seismic sensors show that this dwarf planet has little geologic activity. You wonder if detonating a fuel tank would somehow remedy the situation.

        DresSrfLandedPoles* = There is a faint pulsating vibration, like a heartbeat. But it's not a heartbeat, because that would be crazy.

        //DresSrfLandedMidlands* =
        //DresSrfLandedLowlands* =
        //DresSrfLandedRidges* =

        DresSrfLandedHighlands* = You tap the ground a few times. Yep, it's on. This planet is just dead.

        //DresSrfLandedImpactCraters* =
        //DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta* =

        DresSrfLandedCanyons* = There's no internal movement. Aside from the impacts of meteors, the needle never moves.
