        DresSrfLanded = Seismic sensors show that this dwarf planet has little geologic activity. You wonder if detonating a fuel tank would somehow remedy the situation.

        DresSrfLandedPoles = There is a faint pulsating vibration, like a heartbeat. But it's not a heartbeat, because that would be crazy.

        //DresSrfLandedMidlands =
        //DresSrfLandedLowlands =
        //DresSrfLandedRidges =

        DresSrfLandedHighlands = You tap the ground a few times. Yep, it's on. This planet is just dead.

        //DresSrfLandedImpactCraters =
        //DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta =

        DresSrfLandedCanyons = There's no internal movement. Aside from the impacts of meteors, the needle never moves.
