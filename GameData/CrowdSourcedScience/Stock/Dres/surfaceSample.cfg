        DresSrfLanded = You take some sand. The color will go great on your sandcastle at home.
        DresSrfLanded = You find traces of a large number of iron, likely deposited here by impacts over time.
        DresSrfLanded = The soil is very dark here. You are sure the scientists back on Kerbin will be able to find something interesting about the composition of Dres.

        //DresSrfLandedPoles =
        //DresSrfLandedMidlands =
        //DresSrfLandedLowlands =
        //DresSrfLandedRidges =

        DresSrfLandedHighlands = This grainy dust is not suggesting anything.

        DresSrfLandedImpactCraters = The soil is very dark here. You are sure the scientists back on Kerbin will be able to find something interesting about the composition of Dres if you can get it back to them.

        DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The grey metallic sand looks nice and shiny, so you make a sandcastle.

        DresSrfLandedCanyons = Well, THIS is a letdown.
