        DresSrfLanded* = The samples are quiet. Too quiet.

        //DresSrfLandedCanyons* = The samples seem to have no reaction to the surroundings, but while examining them you think you hear a faint screaming. Is it the samples, or you?

        DresInSpaceLow* = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples. Probably a micro-meteor or some swamp gas. You had nothing to do with it.

        DresInSpaceHigh* = The objects are still floating around and making a mess, though some of them have grouped together and occasionally you see a spark between them.
