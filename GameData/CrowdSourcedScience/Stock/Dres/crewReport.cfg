        DresSrfLanded = You were right... it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.

        //DresSrfLandedMidlands =
        //DresSrfLandedLowlands =
        //DresSrfLandedRidges =

        DresSrfLandedHighlands = It is exactly as gray and icy as expected. Not a bit of gray less, not a bit of ice more.

        //DresSrfLandedImpactCraters =

        DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You see scorch marks and are reminded of back home at the KSC.
        DresSrfLandedCanyons = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mun. Wait.

        DresInSpaceLow = It's very gray and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better gray-resistant landing legs.
        DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
        DresInSpaceLow = You see debris from what looks like an impact...

        DresInSpaceHigh = You see what appears to be burn marks, and suddenly feel bad for Dres.
        DresInSpaceHigh = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
        DresInSpaceHigh = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
