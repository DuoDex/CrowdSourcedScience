        KerbinSrfLanded = The temperature here is 'normal'. Guess the calibration worked.

        KerbinSrfLandedWater = You ensure that the thermometer is adequately sealed near the water. You wouldn't want to release mercury into the sea.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = Spray from the salty water has encrusted the thermometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading. So you make something up.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The temperature here is quite pleasant. This would be a nice place to live.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You don't need any fancy measurements to tell you that it's nice outside.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The thermometer tube seems to have exploded in the thin atmosphere here. We really shouldn't have bought the cheapest thermometer available. Oh well, no temperature reading today.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = It's quite chilly out here! The thermometer agrees.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = You wonder if there's a setting on the thermometer that allows it to warn you of sand-sharks.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to go for a swim in the sea right over there.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The temperature reports a chilly -15 degrees. You are glad to be inside your nice warm spaceship. With snacks!
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = It's cold sure, but the windchill is even worse! You hope it doesn't blow you off the mountain.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's hot here. That's not a reading, you learned it in primary school.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Large plumes of heat are rising from the surface of the desert.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The temperature here is very hot.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The thermometer quickly rises beyond the scale limit. You put it back into the shadows before it bursts.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature here appears to fluctuate depending on the time of day.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature is bad, and it's getting worse every minute.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Man the EVA is gonna suck.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The thermometer reading makes you want to go home and snuggle under a blanket.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = It's cold enough to keep things permanently frozen here.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = If this is normal, you hate to think of how cold it can get.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Welp. That explains all the ice.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = It's cold enough to freeze even salty sea water completely solid.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = A rise in temperature would be very alarming, considering you are standing on something eminently meltable.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = A note at the back of the equipment manual states "Warranty void if exposed to temperatures below 0C". You're pretty sure it's colder than that.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = A thick layer of rime ice has formed on the thermometer, telling you all you need to know.

        KerbinSrfSplashed = The engineers hadn't planned on water, so the numbers have all washed off the thermometer, making it unreadable.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water is colder than the surrounding air.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You have to stick your head underwater in order to see what the thermometer says.

        KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = The water cools down the temperature a bit, and it's a bit cooler than would be comfortable.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands =

        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The water here is warmer than in the open ocean, perhaps because there's less of it for the Sun to warm up.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Just the right temperature to be a lucrative shark mating area.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains =

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = The water is invitingly warm. This place would make a great inland beach resort.

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = It's hot enough you could reheat some snacks by dunking them in the water.

        KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = It's pretty cold, but not quite cold enough to freeze the water.

        KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid, so why is there liquid water here?

        //KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf =

        KerbinFlyingLow = The atmospheric drag causes a measurable increase in temperature.

        KerbinFlyingLowWater = The air seems to be cooled by the water, and the temperature is lower that average here.
        KerbinFlyingLowWater = You keep an eye out for sudden tsunamis as the thermometer takes its reading of the surrounding air.

        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The temperature seems cool and comfortable. It is probably due to the acres of green grass that stretch to the horizon.
        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = As you perform temperature scans over the Grasslands, you take care not hit any trees.

        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The snow and ice of the mountains has gotten stuck to the display of the thermometer. As you wipe it off and take a reading you are reminded of the snacks in your fridge back at home.
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The brisk wind of the Highlands is making you feel colder than what the thermometer suggests.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores = Yep, the ambient temperature is the definition of "beach weather".
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = The thermometer reads a balmy 'medium-hot'. Yep, another beautiful day at the shores. Too bad you're stuck in this rocket.

        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = It's cold, OK. Just look where you're going, and PLEASE don't turn off the SAS again.
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You're too busy dodging sudden mountains to pay attention to your latest temperature scan.
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Glancing back and forth between the mountains beneath you and the thermometer display, you realize that you are stuck between a rock and a cold place.

        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Even here above the surface it is hot. The thermometer reads 270 degrees. You wonder if that is in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. Oh well, the scientist back at KSC will figure it out.
        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Your temperature readings over the desert surprise exactly nobody back at KSC.

        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = It is HOT! You don't know whether it's the normal ambient temperature here or whether the spacecraft is burning up. Either way, we should have installed air conditioning.
        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You pour the remains of your juice pack over the engines in a frantic attempt to keep them from overheating.

        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = It's normally cold at the surface, and now you're flying the wind chill just makes it even colder.
        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The coldness must explain why the surface below is frozen and the plants are stunted. You feel like a genius.

        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = As you read off the temperature to Mission Control, you are envious of how warm they all sound over the radio.

        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = The temperature is extremely low. It has to be, to maintain such a colossal mass of ice like that below.
        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = Wind chill from the strong winds that howl across the flats drops the temperature even lower.

        //KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf =

        KerbinFlyingHigh = Let's see...temperature. Slightly cooler than the fiery pits of hell. Yep, that covers it.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = It is definitely cooler here than on the surface of Kerbin.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = 82. Or is that 28? They never did tell you which side of this thing is up.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The thermometer is hanging on to the capsule by only one corner, and you are afraid if you touch it it will go flying off. We should have used the super-glue instead of the OK-glue.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You resist the urge to place your craft into a steep dive just to see how fast the thermometer changes.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Mission Control declares that they can't distinguish your craft from the background ambient temperature. This is a problem since your engines are currently firing...
        KerbinFlyingHigh = What is it about height that makes things colder?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = At this altitude, the warmth of the beach is a thing of the past.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = It is chilly up here in the thin wisps of the upper atmosphere. You report this to KSC, and they laugh back something about being happy they aren't in your shoes.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature reads -10, but in reality it is probably lower because that is as low as the thermometer can read.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature outside is well into the negatives. You are silently thankful for you climate-controlled spacesuit.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = It appears to be the perfect snack-eating temperature. You open a box just to be sure. For science.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Sitting inside your climate-controlled cockpit, you find that you don't really care what the thermometer thinks of the outside temperature.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Huh, it's pretty darn cold. Hard to believe you were just at the Grasslands.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature here is higher than you expected, what with all the ice and snow. Maybe THAT's why they call it the Highlands.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature seems just about perfect here. You consider doing an EVA without your spacesuit.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = The hellish climate of the Badlands can't touch you up here!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature scan is inconclusive, but you bet it's chilly out there. You tell KSC about your supposition.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You specifically bought one of those fancy low-gravity thermometers for this experiment.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature readings fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Seriously? You want to know the temperature now? We're in space; who cares!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The residual heat of the spacecraft masks the coldness of the empty vacuum of space.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Well, not much heat to measure here.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = As usual the thermometer here is unreliable. You write down its reading anyway for the scientists back at KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Thermometer reading? Check. Space is cold? Check. Time for a snack? Check!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Space is cold everywhere. Unless you are facing the sun or a supernova. Hey! We should go check out one of THOSE!!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Snacks fall out of your mouth and garble your speech as you try to read off the temperature. KSC just regards it as a bad radio transmission, and waits for your next report.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = And the temperature is: perfect for snacking! So how about a few snacks, and then we'll send this report off to KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You wonder if the fact that you're over the Grasslands will affect your temperature readings. Probably not.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The fact that you are over the Highlands does not change the thermometer's opinion on the coldness of space one bit.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you look down over the majestic mountains below you take yet another temperature reading. Stupid science. At least the view is nice.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = In high space over the planet, thermal back radiation from the warm planet is much diminished.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The temperature is even lower than it would be if you were down in the Ice Caps. At least there's no wind chill.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Roses are red, violets are blue (apparently), the mountains are pretty, and space is cold." Mission Control doesn't seem to appreciate your poetry.
