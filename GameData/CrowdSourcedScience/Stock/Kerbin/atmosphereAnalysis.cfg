        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The air being more terrestrial or marine depends on the time of day and wind direction.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There's lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You decide to do one better and smell the air yourself. Ah, smells like home.

        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Ah so this is what a life-supporting atmosphere is supposed to look like.

        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Even at this low altitude the atmosphere seems thin here. Thoughts of a space-sherpa come to mind.
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The atmospheric sensor reports higher-than-average humidity. This is supported by the thick fog and the light sheen of wet grass.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores = A nosy seagull gets its beak stuck in the atmosphere sensor's housing. You have to reset the experiment.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = Sand gets sucked into your instrument and you are unable to get an accurate reading. Oh well, snack time!

        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The atmospheric analysis reads "refreshing" in the cool mountain air. You couldn't agree more.
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Strong mountain winds buffet your craft. The atmospheric sensor is beside itself with joy.

        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much drier over the desert.
        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Very little signs of precipitation. No wonder the place looks so thirsty.

        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = The sensor records a sulfurous rotten egg smell in the atmosphere. So this is why they call it the Badlands.
        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Atmospheric analysis of the surrounding air makes you very glad that you brought your spacesuit.

        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You try to avoid snowdrifts in order to give the atmosphere sensor a better reading.
        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The atmosphere analysis sensor gets clogged up with all the dust flying around. You report this back to KSC.

        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The cold air has caused some of the instruments to stop functioning. You send the results you can back to KSC and settle down with a mug of hot cocoa and some snacks.
        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You feel sorry for the atmospheric sensor, exposed as it is to the subzero temperatures of Kerbin's polar regions.

        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = There are strong traces of windblown snow kicked up by the powerful winds that blow over the icy flats.
        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = At least in the absence of hills you don't have to pay attention to very much while the gadget does its thing.

        KerbinFlyingHighGrasslands = You let the atmospheric sensor do its thing. You don't anticipate any earth-shaking discoveries.

        KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = Pfft, Highlands yeah right. Whoever named this place must have pretty low standards.
        KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = The atmosphere here seems squeezed between the high altitude of the mountains below, and the invisible barrier of space above. You are somewhere between a rock and no-place.

        KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = The sensor reads 0 humidity. In fact it looks like the needle is bent as the gauge tries to register negative numbers.
        KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = The humidity readings make you want to take off your spacesuit and lather yourself in lotion.

        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Analysis of the Badlands' atmosphere makes it difficult to believe that you're still on Kerbin.
        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Glancing nervously at the sensor's readouts, you sincerely hope that Mission Control doesn't tell you to go lower.
        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Ozone, check. Carbon Monoxide, check. Hydro-fluorocarbons, check. Yep, we're in the Badlands.

        KerbinFlyingHighTundra = The atmosphere here seems unforgiving. Kind of like you are about eating all of Bill's snacks.
        KerbinFlyingHighTundra = The data from the atmospheric analysis makes you happy that you're wearing layers under your spacesuit.

        KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps = Even this far away the Ice Caps seem to be sucking the heat and moisture from the atmosphere around you. We're not going to land down there, are we?
        KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps = Atmospheric analysis is complete. Can we go home now? It's cold.

        KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf = The ice has petered out by now, but there's still enough moisture in the air to glaze the sensor in ice.
        KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf = The gas mix high above the ice plains seems much the same as over the equator.
