        KerbinSrfLandedWater* = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater* = The air being more terrestrial or marine depends on the time of day and wind direction.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = There's lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You decide to do one better and smell the air yourself. Ah, smells like home.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There's a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains* = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well. The goat one peak over is shivering.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains* = The sensor tells you that you'll be gasping for breath soon after stepping out of your craft.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = This can't be right, the sensor is detecting the atmosphere as solid! Oh wait, it's just dust-clogged again.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = The sensor complains about a mosquito dive-bombing it. Apparently it's carrying malaria.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = It's not so bad here. You wonder what all the fuss was about.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = The Gooey puddle you just stepped in appears to be eating through the material of your spacesuit. Better get back to the ship before the atmosphere outside is the same as inside your spacesuit.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra* = The sensors report that the air is cold but otherwise nominal.

        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands* = Ah so this is what a life-supporting atmosphere is supposed to look like.

        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands* = Even at this low altitude the atmosphere seems thin here. Thoughts of a space-sherpa come to mind.
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands* = The atmospheric sensor reports higher-than-average humidity. This is supported by the thick fog and the light sheen of wet grass.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores* = A nosy seagull gets its beak stuck in the atmosphere sensor's housing. You have to reset the experiment.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores* = Sand gets sucked into your instrument and you are unable to get an accurate reading. Oh well, snack time!

        KerbinFlyingLowMountains* = The atmospheric analysis reads "refreshing" in the cool mountain air. You couldn't agree more.
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains* = Strong mountain winds buffet your craft. The atmospheric sensor is beside itself with joy.

        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts* = You find that the air is much drier over the desert.
        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts* = Very little signs of precipitation. No wonder the place looks so thirsty.

        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands* = The sensor records a sulfurous rotten egg smell in the atmosphere. So this is why they call it the Badlands.
        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands* = Atmospheric analysis of the surrounding air makes you very glad that you brought your spacesuit.

        KerbinFlyingLowTundra* = You try to avoid snowdrifts in order to give the atmosphere sensor a better reading.
        KerbinFlyingLowTundra* = The atmosphere analysis sensor gets clogged up with all the dust flying around. You report this back to KSC.

        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps* = The cold air has caused some of the instruments to stop functioning. You send the results you can back to KSC and settle down with a mug of hot cocoa and some snacks.
        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps* = You feel sorry for the atmospheric sensor, exposed as it is to the subzero temperatures of Kerbin's polar regions.

        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf* = There are strong traces of windblown snow kicked up by the powerful winds that blow over the icy flats.

        KerbinFlyingHighGrasslands* = You let the atmospheric sensor do its thing. You don't anticipate any earth-shaking discoveries.

        KerbinFlyingHighHighlands* = Pfft, Highlands yeah right. Whoever named this place must have pretty low standards.
        KerbinFlyingHighHighlands* = The atmosphere here seems squeezed between the high altitude of the mountains below, and the invisible barrier of space above. You are somewhere between a rock and no-place.

        KerbinFlyingHighShores* = Atmospheric analysis reports humidity and trace amounts of salt in the air.
        KerbinFlyingHighShores* = The scanner registers a faint trace of seaweed and crabs, even way up here.

        KerbinFlyingHighMountains* = The air here seems crisp and refreshing. Now time for a refreshing snack!

        KerbinFlyingHighDeserts* = The sensor reads 0 humidity. In fact it looks like the needle is bent as the gauge tries to register negative numbers.
        KerbinFlyingHighDeserts* = The humidity readings make you want to take off your spacesuit and lather yourself in lotion.

        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands* = Analysis of the Badlands' atmosphere makes it difficult to believe that you're still on Kerbin.
        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands* = Glancing nervously at the sensor's readouts, you sincerely hope that Mission Control doesn't tell you to go lower.
        KerbinFlyingHighBadlands* = Ozone, check. Carbon Monoxide, check. Hydro-fluorocarbons, check. Yep, we're in the Badlands.

        KerbinFlyingHighTundra* = The atmosphere here seems unforgiving. Kind of like you are about eating all of Bill's snacks.
        KerbinFlyingHighTundra* = The data from the atmospheric analysis makes you happy that you're wearing layers under your spacesuit.

        KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps* = Even this far away the Ice Caps seem to be sucking the heat and moisture from the atmosphere around you. We're not going to land down there, are we?
        KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps* = Atmospheric analysis is complete. Can we go home now? It's cold.

        KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf* = The ice has petered out by now, but there's still enough moisture in the air to glaze the sensor in ice.
