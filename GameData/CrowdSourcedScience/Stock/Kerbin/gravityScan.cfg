        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The graviolis aren't too sure about this wet stuff, but they report that everything else seems in order.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The graviolis are soaking wet, but they report nominal gravity.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The graviolis seem strangely attracted to the grass. There aren't more of them, but they seem more content here.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The grass doesn't seem to be too bothered by gravity. Look at them, swaying in the wind and such.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Huh, the gravity here is exactly the same as at Jeb's house. Who'd have guessed.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The graviolis seem very weak here. Maybe it has something to to with the high altitude.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The graviolis react differently as you pass over certain hills and valleys.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The graviolis throw themselves a beach party. You're not invited.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = You are distracted by all the swimsuit-clad Kerbals around you, but manage to take a reading of the local gravity and sign a few autographs as well.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = On solid ground you are able to detect the faint anomalies in the gravitational field caused by the mountain you are standing on. The guys back at KSC will be excited!
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You can tell that the gravity is still on by the fact that you're standing on a mountain instead of floating in outer space.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You look around at some dried bones scattered on the ground, and feel the tug of Kerbin's gravitational field pulling you to the earth. Or maybe that is just your imagination. Time for some snacks!
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You splash juice over the gravity scanner. It was probably pretty thirsty.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The gravity here is just...gravity. The scientists said it would somehow be 'bad' gravity. Wish we were paid like them for being wrong, rather than exploding in a giant crashing fireball.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Yep, looks like the same gravity you find anywhere else on Kerbin. Seems that gravity isn't too impressed by the so-called 'Badlands'.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Gravity doesn't care that you're in the Badlands. Gravity knows how to treat everything right.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wonder how much bigger the bears and wolves would be without this gravity. Thanks gravity!
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The gravity here seems to be stunted, just like everything else in this bleak landscape.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The graviolis are all huddled together, and you can't get an accurate reading. Even THEY are freezing their butts off out here!
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The scanner gives some interesting readings of the sub-surface. What secrets lie beneath the polar ice caps?

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Gravity is lower compared to the land of the ice caps. There must be a serious lack of rock beneath your feet.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = You hit upon the idea of using gravimetric analysis to map the bathymetry underneath the impenetrable pack ice.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The gravimeter abruptly stops working. On closer inspection, the heat of the circuitry melted some salty ice, shorting the very expensive equipment.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = Gravitationally speaking, the southern ice sheet is as featureless as its surface.

        KerbinSrfSplashed = The instrument starts sparking and shorts out before you can take a reading.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The gravity scan detects disturbances seemingly originating from far underneath the ocean's surface...
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The sensor has detected changes in the local gravity that seem to be related to the passing of the Mun.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedShores =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedTundra =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf =
        //KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf =

        //KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in. What a surprise!

        KerbinInSpaceLowWater = As you activate the gravity scanner, you wonder what sort of effects the oceans might have on the reading.
        KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The sensor shows a surprising variance as it passes over the oceans, hinting at what lies deep below the waters.

        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = You happily munch on a snack while performing a gravity scan over the Grasslands.
        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = A scientist at KSC once told you that without gravity, the grass would grow into outer space! On second thought, he probably wasn't a real scientist.
        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The instrument surveys the gravity over the Grasslands. It appears the field is very stable here.

        KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The instrument surveys the Highlands of Kerbin. The rolling hills seem to affect local gravity slightly.
        KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The gravity signature of the Highlands is only slightly distinguishable from the plains around it. There must be a lot of missing mass below the surface.

        KerbinInSpaceLowShores = As the gravity scan continues, your mind wanders to good memories you have of Kerbin's shores.
        KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The sensor passes over the shores of Kerbin. The readings appear to be nominal.

        KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Despite the vast edifices below, the Kouguer reading changes little. The geophysicists can figure that one out.
        KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The mountains below give off a suitably impressive gravitational signature.

        KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = The dunes appear to have a stable gravity, though some spikes indicate the underground terrain varies in composition.
        KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Gravitational data from orbit reveals an incredibly complex network of subterranean formations beneath the deserts of Kerbin.

        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = *singing* 'Get low, get low, get low, get low'. Oh yeah, gravity. Yeah, we got that.
        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The gravitational data is completely nominal, something you didn't expect passing over a place called the 'Badlands'.
        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Turns out Badlands gravity is just like regular gravity. Who knew?

        KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You and the graviolis huddle together for warmth.
        KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = The graviolis seem sluggish and unresponsive. You wonder if they need a snack as much as you do.

        KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
        KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = You complete your gravity scan over the Ice Caps. You eat a snack to celebrate. Then you eat another one because you like snacks.

        KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
        KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = You feel much more comfortable doing gravimetry from up here rather than down there, freezing your butt off.

        KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The gravitational signature moves only slightly as you pass over the southern ice cap. Looks like it's water all the way down.
        KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Graviolis cascade down towards the surface, closely following magnetic field lines.

        //KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gravity seems to be incredibly high for a celestial body of this size. It must be composed of an extremely dense material.

        KerbinInSpaceHighWater = Your gravity scan high over Kerbin's Water ends much like your other gravity scans. With a delicious snack.
        KerbinInSpaceHighWater = The smooth stream of graviolis creates a strong reading. You send the report back to KSC for their analysis.

        KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = Gravity scans over the Grasslands are normal...too normal. You begin to suspect that the grass is hiding something.
        KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = As you fly high over the Grasslands you can feel the graviolis swarming around you. They seem excited.

        KerbinInSpaceHighHighlands = Even at this distance, the gravity scan picks up the distinct signature of the massive mountains below.
        KerbinInSpaceHighHighlands = Gravity scans from high orbit are yielding some interesting tidbits about the Highlands. Speaking of tidbits, where did you put those snacks?

        KerbinInSpaceHighShores = The gravitational signature changes rather significantly as you pass over the shores and over the ocean.
        KerbinInSpaceHighShores = The gravity seems pretty normal here, though you can tell the graviolis wish they were at the beach.

        KerbinInSpaceHighMountains = The massive mountain range below registers on your gravitational scanner as you fly by. Just another day in the life of an kerbonaut.
        KerbinInSpaceHighMountains = The graviolis are excited about the prospect of passing over the mountains of Kerbin.

        KerbinInSpaceHighDeserts = Orbital gravity scans make the deserts far more interesting than they appear to be to the naked eye.
        KerbinInSpaceHighDeserts = The graviolis here seem dry and dusty like the surface below. You consider offering them a glass of water, but have no idea how to speak gravioli.

        KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = The sensor gives a very negative readout as you pass over the badlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = You somehow get the feeling that the gravitational sensor disapproves of what it's seeing.
        KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = The gravity scanner seems surlier than usual.

        KerbinInSpaceHighTundra = You wonder why the gravity field seems weaker here, and then remember that you are flying over the Tundra. Everything is smaller in the Tundra.
        KerbinInSpaceHighTundra = You let the gravity scanner do its thing while you admire the view you have over Kerbin's Tundra.

        KerbinInSpaceHighIceCaps = The spike in graviolis here indicates a large mass below. Maybe it's the Ice Caps?
        KerbinInSpaceHighIceCaps = The Ice Caps' gravitational signature is surprisingly distinctive considering your distance.

        KerbinInSpaceHighNorthernIceShelf = The frozen-over Northern Ocean bears a distinctive gravitational signature together with the polar hills ringing it.
        KerbinInSpaceHighNorthernIceShelf = Frozen sea appears to have the same gravimetric characteristics as normal sea.

        KerbinInSpaceHighSouthernIceShelf = You could swear the gravitational signature changed since you last looked. Did a bug lump of ice just melt?
        KerbinInSpaceHighSouthernIceShelf = Most of the reading is clouded out by noise from the adjoining continent.
