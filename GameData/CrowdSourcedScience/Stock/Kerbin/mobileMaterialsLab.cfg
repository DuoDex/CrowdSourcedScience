        //KerbinSrfLanded = Why are we performing this experiment here? We could have just stayed at home and done it.

        KerbinSrfLandedWater = You take care to limit your samples' exposure to the humid sea air. Some of them are rather susceptible to corrosion.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The materials lab seems particularly damp. You pull out a mop and bucket to be safe as you finish your report.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The materials lab has grass-stains on it now from that landing. So much for returning it to the manufacturer for a refund when we are done.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You crack open window as you write up the lab report and bask in the warm sunlight and soothing breeze.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = A blade of grass flies into the lab and lands right in your experiment, ruining the results. Oh well, we'll just make something up for the folks back at KSC.
        KerbinSrflandedGrasslands = A butterfly flies into your experiment. You spend a distracting amount of time thinking up various non-lethal methods to get rid of it.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Most of the materials in the lab have either boiled off or frozen at this altitude. You decide that it's not worth the effort to do research, and decide to have some snacks instead.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = One of your samples gets loose and you have to go and chase it down as it rolls down the hill.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = You give the materials lab a wee beach umbrella.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = Why are you in the lab when you could be at the beach?
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The report seems to be the same as last time. You wish you could be hanging out on the shores right now.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = Your lab report contains thinly-veiled suggestions that the next set of experiments be done at the beach. For science, of course.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The lab slowly rocks back and forth as you perform your experiments perched on top of a particularly craggy mountain.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You're quite certain that lugging around an entire materials lab while on top of a mountain is as dangerous as it is unnecessary. But hey, you're just an astronaut.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Watching the dust swirl among the samples, you realize that you're going to have to spend a lot of time cleaning them up for the next mission.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You take your juice pack and pour it all over the samples to prepare them for the dry, dusty ordeal they are about to face. Mission Control sighs and tells you to use a different set of samples.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry what it will do to them.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Turns out the Badlands is a bad place for a materials lab. Who knew?
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Some of your samples are starting to give you attitude. You're pretty sure this a bad sign.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The samples inside your lab have devolved into a hunter-gatherer state as a response to the harsh conditions of the Tundra.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The lab seems small and cramped here. You quickly finish your report and get some fresh air.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = As you open the materials bay, snow rapidly accumulates inside, making it difficult to perform your experiments.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The materials seem to have shrunk in their containers, which makes completing your research difficult. Hey, we're getting hazard pay for this, right?

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The materials have congregated around the bay lamp for warmth. It must be pretty darn cold.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The icy samples keep slipping away from being grabbed. Don't they want to come into the warmth?

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = Your samples are huddling together for warmth in the frigid environment.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The thin glaze of ice that has formed on the bay doors cracks and cascades off as they grind open.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You submerge the materials bay into the water and it comes back up with a decent haul of codfish.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been enlightening.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.

        KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = As expected, most of the samples sink while others float out. You swear you saw a yellow rubber ducky among them.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]

        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = A dastardly seagull has made off with half the samples in the materials lab and left you a foul-smelling present. Damn you seagull, damn you.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The materials seem to have been contaminated by bits of sand and seaweed, but you perform your experiments anyway.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = As you open the materials bay a seagull flies out and poops on your hand. It seems you can never escape the reach of the beach...
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You're pretty happy about the experiment results...but not as happy as you would be if you were on the beach. So how about it, Mission Control?

        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains = [N/A]

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Several of the samples expand from soaking up water. The cactus looks particuarly pleased.

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = A few samples have melted into the water, and will probably create new forms of Badlands life.

        KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = Materials float just as well in cold water as warm water. You know this because the bay is full of it.

        KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = You have determined that water temperature does not affect buoyancy.

        KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf = You see a rubber duck float out of the Materials Bay, frozen in a block of ice.

        KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf = The cold water reacts slowly with even the volatile materials.

        KerbinFlyingLow = As you fly over the Badlands, you hear evil laughter and what sounds like thunder coming from inside the lab.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You resist the urge to cackle madly and speak in a German accent as you pass over the Badlands.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Some of the materials get sucked out the bay door when you accidentally open the door. You plan on blaming a seagull when they land on someone below.
        KerbinFlyingLow = The lab is in complete disarray after hitting turbulence.
        KerbinFlyingLow = A particularly persistent bird is following you around, perhaps attracted by the smell emanating from your exposed samples.
        KerbinFlyingLow = The lab seems to be picking up some of the dry, dusty particles from the surface as you fly so close to the ground.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Your low-altitude flight is kicking up a lot of dust. That can't be good for the samples.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You find it difficult to concentrate on your lab research flying this close to the terrain. You write down some random gibberish to send back to KSC.

        KerbinFlyingLow = Materials are strewn across the lab as the ship performs a mostly-expected gravity turn.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You hope the autopilot is up-to-snuff as you write your lab report while your craft zips past several mountain peaks.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You are so distracted by the thought of one of the craggy peaks below scraping up against the lab that you're unable to finish the assay.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = You are flying high over the Badlands, so naturally your thoughts turn to recreational substances.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = As you expose the samples to the Badlands' atmosphere, you force yourself to accept the fact that they will never be the same again.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Even at this altitude, none of your samples are spared from the horror that is the Badlands.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = You make note to bring a climate-controlled materials lab next time. The one you currently have appears to be frozen solid.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The samples are shivering too hard for you to get any useful science out of them.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Almost above the mountains and into space. When we get there we should have some snacks. You know, as a reward for awesomeness.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You're quite certain the hills of the Highlands don't grow this high and so you are able to relax and focus on your experiment.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere buffets the side of the lab, distracting you as you write your lab report.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder if that half sandwich you left in the fridge at home is still there, as you write up yet another lab report. When will the reports end and the sandwiches begin??

        KerbinFlyingHigh = All of the materials are still wet from the mishap-that-shall-not-be-named earlier. You jot down some random numbers and send it back to KSC.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You perform your experiments as you fly high over Kerbin's mountains. Oh look! Is that a yeti?

        KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples don't appear to be bothered too much by the fact that they're over the Badlands. Perhaps its influence is limited to within the atmosphere?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The view from the lab is particularly distracting today, and you find it takes an extra hour to complete your report.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, didn't we used to have a microwave in this lab? How are we supposed to get good results when we cant properly heat up our snacks?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples barely react other than giving a small shudder.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You play music as you write your lab report. It reminds you of your home amidst Kerbin's grassy plains.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = LLLLAAAABBBB RRRREEEEPPPPOOOORRRRTTTT IIIINNNN SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE!!!! Ahem, yes, everything is nominal.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You pull out your trusty lab notebook to make a note of what you observe. After 2 minutes of searching for a pencil you remember you are in space now, and find it floating in a corner.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You perform your experiments with a rock from the Highlands as a guest of honor.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You finish your lab work, write up the report, and pull out the snacks. Job well done!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The light reflects off the surface of the planet below as you stare out the window. Oh yeah....science. You finish writing up your report for the kerbals back at KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You quickly slam the door shut on the lab after peeking in. It doesn't look good in there, to say the least.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the bay doors, a sample floats out, heavily convulsing and making high pitched noises via radio. Mission Control denies your request to kill it with fire.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples begins to float out of the main chamber. You manage to close the doors, but not before losing a few to the endless void. You wonder how the lab techs will feel about this.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The materials seem to float through empty...space. That's it! We must be in space!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Low-gravity experiments in space over Kerbin. Just another day for a kerbonaut.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab has a certain 'vacuuminess' to it here. You note that in the report to KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the doors of the material bay, you see tiny dust particles from the deserts of Kerbin float free. You wonder where they will eventually end up and hope the answer isn't 'in your sock'.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab seems peaceful as you go about your study over the grassy plains below.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The mountains below have little to no bearing on the outcome of your experiments. Even so, you reference them in your report as much as possible, to impress the folks back home.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You consider how nice it is to be in the lab rather than in the Badlands below you.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The materials bay seems cautiously optimistic about being this far away from the Badlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = This far out, the Badlands have little to no noticeable affect on your array of samples.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Some of your samples create interesting refractions as they are exposed to the sunlight reflecting from the blue waters of Kerbin.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write down your lab report you visually confirm that Kerbin's oceans do indeed make up the majority of its surface.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab shimmers blue in the reflected light from Kerbin's ocean below. Or maybe you're just delirious from lack of snacks.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You are unable to properly finish your lab report. The sight of all the water below you keeps making you get up and go to the bathroom.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You finally finish writing a disgustingly long lab report. Oh well, at least your office has a good view.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The air in the lab seems stale and cramped even though you are far above the planet. You wonder why.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ah a quiet journey, a mouthful of snacks, and a beautiful view of Kerbin's mountain ranges! If it wasn't for the lab report you have to write, this would be the perfect moment.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write up your lab report, you marvel at how smooth Kerbin looks despite the Highlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You brought along some dirt from Kerbin's Grasslands for this experiment. You're not really sure what to do with it though.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Far below there is a biome of some sort. You are too far away from the planet to tell which one, though. We need better facilities in this lab.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down at the surface through the lab window as you process results from your latest experiment. Kerbin looks so small from up here.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gel samples shrink, boil and freeze simultaneously when exposed to the hard vacuum of space.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You take your little ball of sand from Kerbin's desert and let it loose into outer space. You fondly imagine it growing up and one day becoming a mighty asteroid! Then you remember what asteroids tend to do to inhabited planets and desperately try to gather it back up.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The sight of Kerbin from high over the Ice Caps is enough to make you pause your experiments and take some time to enjoy the view.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You intermittently stare out the window at the mountains below as you write up your report. Space is awesome!
