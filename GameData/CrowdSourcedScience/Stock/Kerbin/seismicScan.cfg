        KerbinSrfLandedWater = Wave impacts generate rythmic thumps on the seismograph.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The seismometer registers the gentle jostling of the blades of grass against it. Other than that it doesn't seem to be reading anything.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You wonder what it is about grass that keeps the earthquakes away.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You jump up and down a few times, just so the seismometer will have something to show to Mission Control.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = With such a massive mountain below your feet you have little hope of the seismometer registering a reading. So you absentmindedly munch on some snacks to pass the time.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Seismographic readings give hints of the turbulent geologic history of the Highlands.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You roll the seismometer down the hill and laugh at how confused it gets.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The seismometer registers the force of waves hitting the shore and not much else.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The shallow water echoes vibrations from the muddy soil below.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = Seismic waves reflecting within the subsurface reveal many layers of material comprising previous beaches from long ago.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The mountain seems far too large and sturdy to be shaken by anything, but you set up the sensor anyway to appease the folks back at KSC.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You send your seismic data back to KSC and glance nervously at the mountain beneath you. They'll tell you if there was an active volcano down there, right?
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = There's not much activity here beyond the odd rockfall. The titanic processes that built these great citadels of rock must have ceased aeons ago.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = *singing* "I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it feels good to be out of the rain". Oops! As you were singing you drop the accelerometer into one of the cracks in the dry ground, and can't reach it. Oh well, time to make something up for the scientists back at KSC again.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Seismic readings seem to indicate a large artificial structure directly underfoot. The lost tomb of an ancient Kerbal king perhaps?

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The ground here rumbles with constant activity. Maybe this is why they call it the Badlands.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = So here we are, the center of all earthquakes on the entire planet. Or so the scientists say, but who believes them anyway with their fancy 'hypotheses' and 'equations'.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You wonder if there used to be a 'Goodlands' here before the earthquakes.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The seismometer is sensitive enough to detect the subtle tremors cause by the nearby massive ice sheets grinding against rock.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The seismometer trembles at the thought of being left here.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = It appears there is normal seismic activity under the layers of dirt.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The seismometer registers the distant ground impact of an avalanche. You look around nervously.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = One of the nearby glaciers appears to be moving rather fast, judging from all the seismic noise it's making.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The seismometer registers the rumbling, cracking sounds that you can hear coming from underfoot. You are amazed by the power that the ice holds.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Seismic readings indicate that the ice beneath is undergoing movement and stress on an enormous scale.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = Given the fragile state of the ice, an earthquake would be particularly bad right about now.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = A long line of tensional signatures near the edge of the ice shelf suggests a major calving event is about to take place.
