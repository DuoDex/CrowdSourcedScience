    %RESULTS
    {
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer pressure is dropping. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The pressure drops as Montimer grows older.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = Since you are just checking the 'lowly barometer' the new recruits don't recognize you and walk right past.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur = When Baikerbanur was decommissioned, a weather station was set up here. You simply pull the logs from that instead.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad = Mission Control thinks you're still at KSC's launchpad and chews you out.
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The reading is pretty low right now since the crawler is not actively driving over the instrument. NOT FOR LONG THOUGH!
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You realize that the pressure drops the higher you climb the pole.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time.
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission control is glad to hear that the reading indicates favorable conditions for a launch. And for lunch too!
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD = As you attempt to record your observation, one of the research scientists comes over to explain that a millibar is not where those little umbrellas that come in drinks come from.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding = The folks at R&D disassemble your barometer before you have a chance to take a reading. What did you expect?
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab = You hope to get a reading before your instrument is disassembled for parts by the staff here, by hiding in this corner.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding = You point at an imaginary flying purple elephant to distract the staff here from disassembling your instrument just long enough to get a reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory = How fitting to take your barometric pressure observation here. Must have been fate.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab = OK, how many labs are there here?? You're tired of barometric pressures, and just want some snacks.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab = The smallness of the lab constricts the atmosphere, causing a higher reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks = You get distracted listening to your voice echo in the tanks and forget to take a barometric reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel = The barometer blows away before you are able to record the results. Oh well, it was worth a try.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storm fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight!
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Another beautiful day at the SPH, and the barometer confirms it.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You eye the menacing clouds on the horizon as the barometer plummets. Maybe we should hold off on that launch after all.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The barometer defers to the gravity sensor on this one.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The staff at the tracking station are unimpressed with your lowly barometer since it can't predict space-storms.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You place the barometer right in the center of the dish just to aggravate those annoying Kerbals at the tracking station.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = You take a reading at the focal point of the dish, hoping that somehow it will focus the atmospheric pressure.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The mercury from the barometer leaks all over the dish as you take your reading. Oh well, you never liked the guys at the tracking station anyway.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = Well, here you are, at the center of all those annoying, weaselly little....oh yeah barometer: seems normal.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = You are surprised to find a normal reading here. Probably about the only thing that IS normal here.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = I don't know about the atmosphere, but the people here are definitely under a lot of pressure.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = Looking at the pod you consider how much more -and less- pressure it endured than your barometer could ever hope to.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers inside are under pressure to get things done on time.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The barometer detects a small leak. You consider informing Gus Kerman but refrain from it, realizing that he probably doesn't care.
        KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = The runway on the island appears to be at a slightly higher altitude than The KSC Runway.
        KerbinSrfLandedWoomerang = In the foothills of the mountains, air pressure is a bit lower at this pad.
