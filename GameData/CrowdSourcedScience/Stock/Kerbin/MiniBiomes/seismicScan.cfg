    {
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments. Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The needle jumps and shakes violently; moments later, you hear a distant explosion. Looks like somebody let Bill into the cafeteria kitchen again.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The lack of geologic activity - explosions not counting - reminds you why they built the space center here.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates heavy surface-borne activity nearby.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates high levels of seismic activity coming from...the research lab.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The needle moves. Mortimer probably exploded again over the spending of funds.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = You try to impress the new recruits with the word seismometer, but you're not sure if it worked.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur = The seismometer registers a boulder rolling towards the centre from the mountain. Perhaps this is why they moved to Cape Kerbal.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad = The vessel jolts very slightly as the decaying concrete slowly crumbles under it.
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Seismometer goes off the charts as the crawler slowly trundles by.
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The needle moves as you drop down the pole.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The ground trembles with the ghosts of failed launches past.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder if repeated rocket launches have caused the ground to become unstable.
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = All the stomping around here registers clearly on the seismometer.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD = The R&D scientists disassemble the seismometer for parts.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding = You miss the reading while explaining to one of the scientists how this thing works.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab = You stuff the seismometer into the corner, and hope that no one remembers it.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding = The R&D scientists interpret the data from the seismometer in real time, and you realize maybe this science stuff really IS useful.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory = Your observations are observed in the observatory by an observer.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab = The seismometer falls on its side and breaks. Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab = Despite the cramped conditions the seismometer performs perfectly and registers: absolutely nothing.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel = As usual, your instrument gets blown away here before you can take a reading. Why do you even try?
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The ground here conducts vibrations about as effectively as concrete. You report your findings to the tower, but they don't seem very impressed.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You calibrate the detector one more time before lifting off.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The planes are too light to register anything on the seismometer here.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Nope, still nothing. Let's have some snacks while we're bored.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You bang on the side of the tank, which registers on the seismometer.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = You wonder if dumping all the water will make the needle move.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = Nothing happening here. No big surprise.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You consider what a waste of your time taking this measurement is.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Vibrations from the moving dish overwhelm everything. Why are we even taking this measurement?
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = Ugh, more seismometer measurements. Maybe you'll be nicer to Gene next time.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You throw the seismometer at the side of the building hoping that THAT might finally register a reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = All the activity at the VAB registers clearly on the seismometer.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = You get distracted looking at all the rockets and completely forget about taking a reading here.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = Reading: nominal. Yep, that's really it.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = You bang on the side of the tank, which registers on the seismometer.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = Sawing and hammering from the workshop ripples out towards the sensor.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
        KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = Waves hitting the island provide the majority of noise.
        KerbinSrfLandedWoomerang = The framework of the pad vibrates very slightly as the wind whistles through it.
