        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The goo lunges towards the nearest dumpster, perhaps the one that the goo can came from in the first place.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo has given up and is heading home.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The goo seems to be giving you a funny look.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo seems bored.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo looks as if it is a puddle of water.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Goo needs to go back to the lab.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The Goo wants to go the other way.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = You convince the new recruits that tasting the Goo is a rite of passage.
        //KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur =
        //KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad =
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Goo stands its ground.
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The Goo looks up the pole in Awe.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo doesn't seem to be doing much right now. Maybe you should poke it with a stick.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo seems very excited for what's about to happen.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo is now a little nervous.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo wants to go somewhere
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo appears to be wondering what the next few minutes are going to entail.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The Goo appears to have braced itself for high g-forces.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Don't worry, The Goo won't do anything right now. It'll just sit there.
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The Goo seems enamored with all the flashing lights on the control panels.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD = The Goo looks forward to researching the researchers.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding =  The Goo looks around inquisitively at all the eyes peering down at it.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab = The Goo gets down to business doing its own research.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding = The Goo contemplates the meaning of Kerbalhood.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory = The Goo observes you observing it.  Eerie.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab = The good sloshes to the side of its container in honor of the research that has been performed here in the past.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab = The Goo looks cramped here, like it needs to stretch its...uhhhh...self. Yeah, that's it: stretch itself.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks = The Goo promptly begins determining its compatibility with the substance in the tanks.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel = The Goo is promptly splattered against the wall as you open the container.  What did you expect, it's a wind tunnel!
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The Goo seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The Goo has a black tone as light reflects off the runway into the canister.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The engineers at the SPH spread some of the Goo on the control surfaces, in hopes of actually making their plane fly.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The Goo is nonplussed.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The Goo contemplates how much of the tank it could fill.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The Goo splits itself into pieces and hides in the tanks.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The Goo does indeed seem a bit watered down here.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The Goo seems indifferent to this place despite you muttering under your breath.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = The Goo sticks to the dish as you spread it over the surface.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = You toss the entire container of Goo at the dish, and it passes completely through, leaving a gaping hole.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The Goo seems to have worked its way into the wiring of the dish and shorted it out.  No big loss.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You threaten to "unleash" the Goo on the first staff member here who looks at you sideways.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The Goo shakes with excitement.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = As you open the container the Goo gets covered in old bits of rocket parts and pieces of blueprints.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The Goo seems somber.  Or maybe inspired.  It's hard to tell.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The Goo comments that its container is far more round than the tank.
        //KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex =
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The Goo seems oddly defensive around the tanks here.
        //KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield =
