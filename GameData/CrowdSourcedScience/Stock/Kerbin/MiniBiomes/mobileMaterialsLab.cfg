    %RESULTS
    {
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials all seem to be posing, preparing for the scientists' examination.
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The samples look like pretty much everything else around here.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The materials shine. You assume they want to look good when facing their bosses.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The new recruits are fascinated to see what a materials lab looks like.
        //KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur =
        //KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad =
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Materials Bay rolls off and gets stuck between the tracks.
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The materials seem unimpressed by your climbing skills.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You think that this experiment is rather superfluous.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The materials are neatly arranged, waiting for launch. You suppress the urge to shake the container.
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission control wonders why you have to do your experiment HERE.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD = You are humbled to perform your experiments here, at their birthplace.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding = You feel right at home here in the lab.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab = The materials fail to indicate which corner you are in.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding = The staff here spend so much time in the lab themselves that they are completely uninterested in your results.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory = You observe the materials while the R&D staff observe you.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab = The materials fail to indicate which side you are at.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab = You are amused at the puny size of this lab compared to yours.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel = Materials were "Ejected due to extreme baro-differential". Luckily you managed to hang on.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The materials are all facing upwards. You hastily turn them sideways.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The great view of the new planes distracts you from getting any meaningful lab work done.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The engineers here eye your lab module with disdain.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You consider how much the lab looks like a tank.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = A leak from the tower washes away your materials before you can experiment on them. Oh well, snack time!
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = You take the leftover materials and throw them at the tracking station, hoping they stick to the side of the building.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You play loud rock music in the lab, saying you are testing materials, but really you're just trying to annoy the folks at the tracking station.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = You position the lab directly in front of the dish to see what effect it will have on the materials.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = The materials leak out and start corroding the tracking dish. You hope no-one else saw that.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You make a show of performing your experiment here, so the tracking station staff can see what a small contribution they make to the program.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = A welding rod fell into your experiment mid-way. You don't know if this will effect the results, so you finish your report anyway.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = The general commotion around here vibrates the materials off the lab bench. You figure this qualifies as a result, and leave to have some snacks.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = You consider how similar the materials you are using are to the pod outside.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = You consider how much the lab looks like a tank.
        //KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex =
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = Your lab blends in with the tanks here, so you can do your experiments incognito.
        //KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield =
        //KerbinSrfLandedWoomerang =
        //KerbinFlyingLowKSC =
        //KerbinFlyingHighKSC =
