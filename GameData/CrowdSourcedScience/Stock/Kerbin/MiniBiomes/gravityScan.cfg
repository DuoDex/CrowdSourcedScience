    %RESULTS
    {
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC* = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration* = The graviolis try to look professional. It's not really working.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex* = The new recruits crowd around to check out your awesome sensor.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur* = Ultra-local gravimetric analysis suggests the presence of a hangar-sized void under the surface.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad* = You can't be bothered to go through the analysis process and pull up some records from when the pad was built long ago.
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway* = You measure the gravity slightly increasing as the crawler goes by.
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole* = Being on top of the pole you realize the gravity of the situation.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad* = The sensor gets burned to a crisp from the rocket exhaust, and is useless now.
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl* = The operators here think that the universe revolves around them, but your gravity readings indicate otherwise.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD* = The graviolis feel very much at home here, surrounded by kerbals that care about them.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding* = You feel like a rockstar with your gravioli detector here.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab* = You don't really care about the gravioli experiment here. You just like how cool it makes you look to take readings.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding* = You have to fight off hordes of R&D techs trying to disassemble your gravioli detector to see how it works.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory* = This is the perfect spot to observe graviolis, and your measurement indicates: nominal. Now that was disappointing.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab* = Confused as to which side this lab is on, the graviolis don't know whether to read positive or negative.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab* = The graviolis feel cramped in here, and register a higher reading than normal.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks* = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around. We should try this experiment somewhere else.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel* = The instrument gets blown away and rolls down the tarmac before you can take an accurate reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway* = You are too busy dodging taxiing planes to get an accurate reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH* = The gravity here seems normal. Snack time!!
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding* = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the VAB.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank* = The graviolis seem too busy doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks* = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around. We should try this experiment somewhere else.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower* = The gravity sensor defers to the barometer on this one.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation* = The graviolis seem to be strangely attracted to the tracking station. You are disappointed in them.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast* = Graviolioliolioliolioliolioli. Sorry, the scanner seems to have gotten stuck with the interference from the dish.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth* = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth* = The graviolis bounce back and forth between the dishes, completely disinterested in your measurement.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub* = The graviolis are drawn into the tracking station like a giant vacuum. You always thought this place sucked.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB* = The graviolis stare in awe at the construction going on inside.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding* = Despite the ongoing debate, the gravity here seems the same as at the SPH.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial* = You take in the gravity of the situation. It is definitely more intense here.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank* = The graviolis are having too much fun doing circles in the tank to pay attention to the task at hand.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex* = Some of the graviolis sneak out to stow away on board the parts inside the building.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks* = The graviolis seem confused with all the tanks around. We should try this experiment somewhere else.
        KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield* = The graviolis are laid back here, after they realise there's no flights around.
        KerbinSrfLandedWoomerang* = The gravimeter is so well calibrated you can follow the foundation piles far deeper into the ground than you expected them to run.
        KerbinInSpaceLowKSC* = The graviolis appear happy to finally be escaping Kerbin's gravitational well.
        KerbinInSpaceHighKSC* = The graviolis look concerned that they may not be able to interact much at this altitude.
