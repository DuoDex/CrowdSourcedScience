    %RESULTS
    {
        KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The temperature rises as an angry Gene Kerman comes over the radio and demands to know what you're still doing there.
        KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The temperature drops. Mortimer seems pleased with our spending of funds.
        KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The temperature here is elevated, but it's probably just due to the new recruits excitement to meet a real astronaut.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanur = The temperature is quite warm at this latitude and location.
        KerbinSrfLandedBaikerbanurLaunchpad = The concrete pad is uncomfortable warm beneath your feet from it's spell baking in the sun.
        KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The thermometer gets crushed under the wheels of the crawler. Oh well, time for some snacks.
        KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You realize that the temperature drops the higher you climb the pole.
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The temperature reading spikes suddenly. Did somebody start the engines?
        KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The temperature here is elevated from the tense atmosphere.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnD = The temperature here fluctuates wildly.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCentralBuilding = The thermometer is sucked into a wormhole by an advanced project here. You decide to write it off.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDCornerLab = You hide the thermometer in the corner hoping no-one will find it.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDMainBuilding = The R&D personnel disassemble your thermometer before you can take a reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDObservatory = You observe the temperature. How fitting.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSideLab = The temperature here is elevated due to the non-stop firing of neurons in this space.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDSmallLab = The size of the lab has no effect whatsoever on the temperature readings, contrary to your hypothesis.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDTanks = The material from the tanks oozes out onto your thermometer and dissolves it before you can get an accurate reading.
        KerbinSrfLandedRnDWindTunnel = The thermometer reads minus one million degrees. Probably from the wind chill.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The jet exhaust skews the temperature reading, and you have to throw out the results.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The temperature here is cool due to the breeze blowing through the SPH.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You are unable to concentrate on taking a reading with the screaming of jet engines in the background.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place.
        KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = 3.983°C - You realize there is as much water in this tower as can be.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = Temperature here is: bored. Oops, that's just you. The temperature is nominal.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You position the thermometer in the direct center of the dish hoping for an exciting result. You are disappointed as usual.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = In your boredom you drop the thermometer and break it. No loss, it's not like there was anything worth reporting here anyway.
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = You wait in anguish for yet another temperature reading. What's the point?
        KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You explain the use of real scientific instruments like the thermometer to the staff at the tracking station.
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The ground spontaneously combusts from years of rocket fuel soaking into it, and the temperature spikes.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = The area here is warmer than usual due to all the nonstop activity.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The temperature reading here is inspiring. Or sad. You can't decide which.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = Something explodes in the VAB proper, and the temperature ticks up.
        KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place.
        KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = It's quite nice, and there aren't planes everywhere to mess it up.
        KerbinSrfLandedWoomerang = The mountain air is cool, and you suspect it would be quite refreshing to breathe.
