        KerbinSrfLandedWater = Does our craft float? Maybe we'll get to test it.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You look forward to opening the capsule door and smelling the fresh earthy smell of grass. Oh yeah, we have to wear these stupid spacesuits even on Kerbin. Who's great idea was that?
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The crew is embroiled in an argument over whether the grass is in fact greener on the other side.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = KSC, we have landed. I think. The altimeter still shows way too high for us to be on the ground, but our velocity is zero. So there you have it. Maybe.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Landing in the Highlands woohoo! Break out the celebratory kilts and bagpipes!

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Arr mateys! Let's show those landlubbers at KSC who the masters of the high seas truly are!
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You don't need to worry about pirates, right? Surely they're only after regular ships not spaceships.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = I hope the hatch doesn't break and flood the pod.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = "I can't swim!"

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Waves lapping against the window are one of the last things you would expect to find in a desert, behind "penguins" and "a Yeti" but ahead of "Mortimer's underwear".

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = The water must be hot, since the capsule interior is getting rather warm.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores = The crew is disappointed by the absence of bikinis in the area.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = You look out the window and see a piece of your rocket fly off. It wasn't important anyways.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = "Crew reporting in. We'll get back to you… about to eat lunch."

        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.

        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look around and see no water for miles. You begin to wonder why you didn't bring more.

        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Please don't land here, please don't land here, please don't land here...

        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The snowy ice caps look so fluffy and soft to land on.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = You are almost in an orbit with your home planet.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what is down there on the surface. If only you had some binoculars.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = Is that the desert down there? It looks awful dry and sandy.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Wow that desert is big. You squint your eyes and try to count the palm trees.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = Nothing down there looks like it's enjoying itself.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The stunted trees below make it seem like you are further away than you already are. Are we in space yet? And when do we break out the snacks?

        KerbinInSpaceLow = Did you remember to pack your Agoraphobia medication?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to micro-gravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = You marvel at how beautifully-manicured kerbalkind's lawn is.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
        KerbinInSpaceLow = This is Major Kerman to Mission Control, I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = It's time to leave the capsule... right?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = You think that KSC may be somewhere below the clouds.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = If you were in charge of creating Kerbin you wouldn't have wasted so much space on an empty desert. They could at least give it a swimming pool or something.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You gaze in wonder at the auroras and wonder if they are related to rainbows.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You contemplate the vast swaths of ice below, wondering if any Kerbals have ever been there.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = You prepare your bathing suit in case Mission Control wants you to land there.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = From this height, you can clearly see where hard ice meets harsh rock meets cold snow. Not a very nice place to live.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = From this distance the already tiny plants growing on the tundra below are so small you can barely see them.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You almost have a panic attack as your instrumentation warns that you are directly over the Badlands. Then you laugh as you remember that you're over a quarter million kilometers away.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You have mixed feelings about being this far away from Kerbin. On the one hand you're pretty far from home, but on the other hand you're pretty far from the Badlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Almost back to KSC. Just an atmosphere and a few thousand kilometers between us.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = From up here, the desert and the oceans look like one giant beach! Beaches are fun!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The spacecraft's crew and some of the guys at Mission Control are playing chess over the radio.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look out the window only to realize you forgot your keys at home.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can see the Badlands from orbit. Ew.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Log: The alien planet seems remarkably similar to our own. Oh wait..."

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Bound for the stars.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You think about all the great times you had hanging out on the shores below. Anyway, hasn't it been a while since we had some snacks??
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = From space, everything looks like a giant beach! Especially the actual beaches!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You observe the Highlands from orbit, marveling at how tiny they look.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You become homesick thinking about the mountains of Kerbin being the closest part of the planet to you at this altitude. Then you have some snacks, and it's all better.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You count the snowstorms passing over the Tundra below and are suddenly glad you don't have to be down there.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is that Tundra below? You are so far from the planet that you can only make a wild guess. So you do, and report it as solid fact back to KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = KSC, I hope you know where I am, cause I just spilled coffee on the roadmap.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ooh that aurora is pretty! Wonder what it looks like from the ground?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there's nothing to walk on.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here."
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The planet appears to be round! It's not flat like we thought!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You strain to see detail on the surface below, but all that you can see are the broad strokes of biomes below.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You hope that when you come back, you'll land in the Grasslands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can barely make out the ridges of Kerbin's mountains from this altitude, but enjoy a few snacks with the view.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = From this distance, Kerbin's mountain ranges blend into one big blob.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the vast ocean below and wonder how many glasses it would take to empty all that water.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you watch the great blue seas of Kerbin pass by you wonder what lays hidden in the depths.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, that ocean really is big. You're glad you aren't trying to sail across it.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you watch Kerbin's oceans from the depths of outer space you ask KSC if there are space pirates. KSC assures you that pirate ships have sails instead of rockets and thus cannot achieve orbit.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can't see any plant life below, and can't decide whether it's because you are too far away, or that nothing grows here.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is it still the Highlands if you're over a quarter million meters above it?
