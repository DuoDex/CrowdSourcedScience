        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = KSC, we have landed. I think. The altimeter still shows way too high for us to be on the ground, but our velocity is zero. So there you have it. Maybe.

        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands* = There can be only one report from the Highlands!
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands* = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores* = The crew is disappointed by the absence of bikinis in the area.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores* = You look out the window and see a piece of your rocket fly off. It wasn't important anyways.

        KerbinFlyingHigh* = Wow that desert is big. You squint your eyes and try to count the palm trees.
        KerbinFlyingHigh* = Over the ice and through the atmosphere, to KSC we go! You wonder if grandmothers house is on the way.
        KerbinFlyingHigh* = You discover that you are the only one of the entire crew who still believes that your presents come from Santa.

        KerbinInSpaceLow* = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = You stare out the window in deep thought, pondering the answer to the ultimate question, before being rudely interrupted by the Mission Control.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your craft they had once held in place.

        KerbinInSpaceLow* = Are we there yet?
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.

        KerbinInSpaceLow* = You prepare your bathing suit in case Mission Control wants you to land there.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = From this height, you can clearly see where hard ice meets harsh rock meets cold snow. Not a very nice place to live.
        KerbinInSpaceLow* = From this distance the already tiny plants growing on the tundra below are so small you can barely see them.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You almost have a panic attack as your instrumentation warns that you are directly over the Badlands. Then you laugh as you remember that you're over a quarter million kilometers away.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You have mixed feelings about being this far away from Kerbin. On the one hand you're pretty far from home, but on the other hand you're pretty far from the Badlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Almost back to KSC. Just an atmosphere and a few thousand kilometers between us.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = From up here, the desert and the oceans look like one giant beach! Beaches are fun!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The spacecraft's crew and some of the guys at Mission Control are playing chess over the radio.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You look out the window only to realize you forgot your keys at home.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You count the snowstorms passing over the Tundra below and are suddenly glad you don't have to be down there.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Is that Tundra below? You are so far from the planet that you can only make a wild guess. So you do, and report it as solid fact back to KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there's nothing to walk on.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = "Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here."
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = The planet appears to be round! It's not flat like we thought!

        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = As you watch the great blue seas of Kerbin pass by you wonder what lays hidden in the depths.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Wow, that ocean really is big. You're glad you aren't trying to sail across it.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = As you watch Kerbin's oceans from the depths of outer space you ask KSC if there are space pirates. KSC assures you that pirate ships have sails instead of rockets and thus cannot achieve orbit.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = You can't see any plant life below, and can't decide whether it's because you are too far away, or that nothing grows here.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh* = Is it still the Highlands if you're over a quarter million meters above it?
