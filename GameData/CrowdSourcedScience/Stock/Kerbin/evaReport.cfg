        //KerbinSrfLanded = Finally. Time to stretch your legs!
        //KerbinSrfLanded = I wish I had brought pants.
        //KerbinSrfLanded = It seems we are on our home planet.

        KerbinSrfLandedWater = You think you see a shark swimming in the water nearby. Wait, no, that's just a landing leg.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = You consider taking your helmet off to smell the fresh ocean breeze, but the frantic yelling over the comms from KSC convinces you otherwise.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = You wonder if a shark can bite through your spacesuit. You try it yourself and fail. You hope that shark teeth aren't any sharper than yours.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you go trudging through the grass you hope you don't step on a cow-patty. The spaceship will stink for the rest of the trip.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You free your potted plant and hope it does well in the wild.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You want to take your helmet off, and breathe the sweet air of your home planet.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You catch yourself as you nearly step into a 100 meter crevasse and slide down a massive glacier. No wonder they call this the Highlands.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The hills are steep and the weather is miserable. No wonder people from the Highlands are always so cranky.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take some sand from the desert and compare it with beach sand. They're actually fairly different!
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = A Girlbal approaches you with a problem. It seems she has too many seashells. You try to tell her that she should sell seashells on the sea shore but find it difficult to finish your sentence.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The wet consistency of beach sand makes excellent building material and you immediately set about building a small shrine to your glory.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You slowly inch your way away from the spacecraft, just to tell KSC you did, hoping that you don't get blown off the mountaintop by the winds.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = A little bit closer and you'll either be the first Kerbal on Mt. Keverest or a green stain on the side of the mountain.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You look around at the mountains around you, taking everything in. You suddenly think to yourself, "What am I still doing here, space is up there, and it's so close!"

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It is so hot here that your feet are burning even through the spacesuit.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You pour your juice onto a small cactus. You decide to call it Mr. Prick and hope it grows up to be a beautiful palm tree. That's how it works, right?

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Your thoughts turn to running back to the capsule and hiding from whatever might live in the Badlands.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You place some snacks on a makeshift altar. You hope that your offering pleases the denizens of the Badlands.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Badlands, Shmadlands. It takes more than a bad name to scare this kerbonaut!

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around sort of hoping you could find a moose to ride on.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around the stunted trees noting that you are FINALLY taller than something.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The ice crystals spider across the visor of your spacesuit. You hope that the suit was made with more care than the parts that went into your rocket.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You eagerly place a magnet on the ground. Nothing observable happens and you walk away disappointed.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You remembered an old tale of explorers who froze to death here and hope you don't end up the same way.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Light from the ship and sky gleams off the shining white ground.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The ground is white. The sky is white. Even the notepad paper is white.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = You're so close to the pole you could swear the compass needle changes orientation with every step.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The ice here isn't snow, and what little loose stuff there is is no good for making snowballs.

        KerbinSrfSplashed = Jeb... is that you biting my leg?
        KerbinSrfSplashed = Hey look, water!
        KerbinSrfSplashed = This is not the same thing as the blue stuff above us.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = This suit was obviously not intended for scuba diving.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming in front of your helmet and you start asking yourself: "What would happen if my suit wasn't waterproof?"
        KerbinSrfSplashed = Another water landing. You feel fortunate that the EVA suits double as emergency flotation devices.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = You feel very floaty...
        KerbinSrfSplashed = Good thing these spacesuits act like flotation devices.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = It's like training in the pool.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = As the water rushes to your face, you begin to thrash and wail and gasp, and then remember your suit is airtight.
        KerbinSrfSplashed = What are those creatures circling below?
        KerbinSrfSplashed = Now I really wish I knew how to swim!

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You hope they made this spacesuit waterproof as well as space-proof.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You calculate the number of snacks you should bring to be able to swim to KSP.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Oh look a fishy! Then you remember what happened to your last goldfish and decide to let this one go.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You have trouble swimming because your helmet is more buoyant than the rest of your spacesuit.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Is that a shark over there?
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Something nibbles on your foot.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Help! Help! Where's a lifeguard when you need them?

        KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = You peer down into the murky water. What could be lurking down there?

        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands = [N/A]

        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You look at the inviting waves and realize that you forgot your swimsuit!
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Ew! Something just touched your foot. Oh wait, it's just seaweed.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains = [N/A]

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = It's not a mirage! There's actally water under you for once!

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = You can feel the heat of the water through your suit. You don't really want to swim for much longer.

        KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = The cold from the water starts to seep into your suit. It's not pleasant.

        KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = The freezing cold of the water seeps right into your bones almost immediately.

        KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf = You keep watch for the nearby icebergs to make sure none of them run you over as you swim.

        KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf = An iridescent sheen of ice forms on your helmet visor as water splashes freeze.

        //KerbinFlyingLow = I'm free! Free falling.
        //KerbinFlyingLow = Get back in! Quick!
        //KerbinFlyingLow = This isn't that high up after all...
        //KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...

        KerbinFlyingLowWater = You hope that sharks can't jump this high.
        KerbinFlyingLowWater = You are so close to the waves that you can almost touch them. KSC recommends against this, though.
        KerbinFlyingLowWater = You wonder if you can skip yourself like a rock if you end up falling off.

        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Mission Control assures you, "don't panic."
        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.
        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = "Why did I go outside? I really want to get back into the capsule!"
        KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.

        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Yep, those are the Highlands. Can I go back in now?
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You are afraid that your helmet will hit the peak of one of the mountains as you fly by. Who thought an EVA was a good idea here, anyway?
        KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You're pretty sure you can reach out and grab a surface sample from the top of one of these hills.

        KerbinFlyingLowShores = You hang on to the craft one-handed as you use your other hand to fight off a particularly persistent seagull.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = You wave at all the Kerbals on the beach below. Surely this will make the news reports.
        KerbinFlyingLowShores = Flying this close to the ground is definitely not over-rated!

        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Uhhhh...It's cold, windy, and we're really close to a mountain. Why are we doing this EVA again?
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = It could be worse. You could be doing this over an active volcano.
        KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The ground is looking awful close. Did you pack a parachute?

        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You can see the cactus and scrub brush clearly from here. Too clearly for comfort.
        KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The air is dusty and dry. Each breath leaves you wanting.

        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Mission Control assures you reckless displays of bravery are well-received in the Badlands.
        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = As you hang on for dear life, you start to question your career choice.
        KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Are you really sure now is a good time?

        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Dude, seriously. You know what happens when we try to EVA here. It never ends well.
        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Those snowdrifts look soft enough to catch you safely. You still don't want to try though.
        KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Your spacesuit keeps you warm even as the brutal winds of the Tundra buffet you outside your craft.

        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You know there is a joke some where in here about an ice hole, but you can't think of it. Must be snack time!
        KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = If you fall, would you break through the ice? Probably best not to try.

        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = Even from this vantage point you can't see anything over the horizon.
        KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = The solid white, flat surface makes it difficult to judge altitude. Don't think about the prospect you could be dangerously low.

        KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = The rushing air somehow makes it even colder. Can we get back in now?
        KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = Looking down at the flat ice you can't tell how fast you're moving, or even if you're moving at all. It's unnerving.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = You might be OK for a few minutes.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Can I go back in now? Please?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Uh, why did we think this EVA was a good idea, again?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = More like EXTREME Vehicular Activity, am I right?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You imagine yourself as an intrepid explorer, daring to push back the boundaries of the unknown...then you look out the window and see your mother. (Sigh) Hi mom.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The wind blowing through the vast hills and valleys of grass reminds you of waves on the surface of the ocean.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Great swaths of brown and tan stretch out before you. You wonder how anything can live in such a dry environment. Including you as you hurtle through the atmosphere.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You begin to have an appreciation for the saying 'as right as rain'.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You hold on for dear life as you hurtle through the atmosphere above some of Kerbin's highest mountains. Too much adrenaline.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Why? Just why? Of all the places to do an EVA why did we have to choose here?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Nothing but ice as far as the eye can see...you really want to go back in now.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it just you or do those mountaintops seem...sharp? You want to go back inside now.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You are now too high to worry about seagulls and can devote all your to attention to hanging on for dear life.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Kinda cold and windy out here. Not at all like being on the surface at the shores. You wish you hadn't smeared sunscreen all over your EVA suit now.

        //KerbinInSpaceLow = You've successfully played hide and seek with Mission Control. Crap.
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! I'M IN SPACE!
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = "Why isn't there any noise? Is something wrong with my spacesuit?"
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = WHEEEEEEE!
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = Mom calls, wondering where you are and when you'll be home for dinner.
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = You wonder why you left your hot dog at Mission Control.
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = I wonder how the lights turn on and off?
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = You think you see a something moving on the Mun's surface. You are officially terrified.
        //KerbinInSpaceLow = This never gets old. It kinda makes you want to... break into song.

        KerbinInSpaceLowWater = You are reminded of the myriad sailors who have been adrift in the ocean below. And here you are, the first one adrift in space.
        KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Why are krakens such a popular topic back at KSC? Don't they live down there in the water?
        KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there's nothing you can do.

        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The hills and valleys of the grasslands seem even closer looking through a spacesuit visor. You begin to long for home. And snacks. Need more snacks.
        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = If you squint really hard you can see some of the scattered debris from your discarded booster stages.
        KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = It's so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.

        KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Yup, that's a mountain down there. What's of greater concern is the mountain of snacks that need to be eaten *nom, nom, nom*.
        KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The Highlands are baby mountains. You wonder if you'll ever get to see them grow up.
        KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = You realize you forgot to eat lunch, and hunt in the cupboards for a snack.

        KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You chuckle at the idea that you are blocking someone's sunlight as they try to tan themselves on the beach below.
        KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You are mesmerized by the glint of the sunshine off the waves below as you stare through the thin visor of your helmet.

        KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = You feel like you are in a dream just floating above the mountains below. Hey, you ARE floating above the mountains below!
        KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = As you float outside your craft, you decide to count mountaintops to help pass the time.
        KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The craggy mountains below look even closer now that there is no spaceship between you and them.

        KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = You look down and contemplate the desert below. Then you contemplate having a snack when you return to the ship, because really, snacks are far more interesting than a dusty desert.
        KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Just looking down is making you thirsty.
        KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = You contemplate the serene beauty of Kerbin's deserts, and long for solid ground.

        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The badlands don't look so bad from up here. YOU HEAR THAT BADLANDS?! YOU DON'T SCARE US!!.....we're not going down there, are we?
        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = As you sigh in relief at the distance separating you from the Badlands, you find yourself thankful that there's no such thing as Badspace.
        KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Somehow you get the feeling that something down there is watching you.

        KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Even with only a thin spacesuit and small amount of space separating you from the landscape below the plant life still looks tiny and stunted.
        KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You marvel at how many plants can look so small as you consider letting go of the ship to float freely through space.
        KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Oh look it's the Tundra! It looks cold and inhospitable even from up here.

        KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = You make some notes about different shades of white. You conclude that the spectrum ranges from white to extremely white.
        KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Your try to touch an aurora but it remains fiendishly out of reach.

        KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = It looks flat, white and boring from up here.
        KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = You squint, and struggle to tell where the land ends and sea ice begins.

        KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The ice caps gleam brilliantly in the sun. They have a splendent beauty from space, but you know how bad they are on the ground.
        KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The great ice platform below traces an outline through the sea that could easily be mistaken for a true continent.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Pssht. Badlands. Whatever. Next they're gonna say Eeloo is a giant snowball and Laythe is populated by another race of Kerbals.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = "If you're hearing this, it means you're taking a long time on this spacewalk. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction."
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lone Kerbal loves it out here.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = It crosses your mind that a thin layer of Mylar and glass is the only thing separating you from nothing.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Staring down at tiny Kerbin, it strikes you as a planet that looks mostly harmless.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see my house from here!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the frosty peaks of the planet below, and contemplate the meaning of life. And the integrity of your spacesuit.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Highlands must be so jealous of you right now.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder why so much ice is built up around each pole...then again, you can't really think of a better place for it.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of Kerbin stretches out before you. You wonder what is happening far away on the rolling hills below.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you conduct your EVA you use the Grasslands of Kerbin as a visual reference point to keep from getting confused.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = If you squint really hard and press your thumb against the glass, you can almost pretend that the Badlands don't exist!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at the beautiful blue ball that is your home-world, you wonder who screwed up and made the Badlands.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Memories of Kerbin's deserts keep you warm as you work in the cold depths of outer space.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float peacefully high above the great mountains of Kerbin, you feel content in your choice of careers.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're in space! Take that Kraken! Who's laughing now, huh???
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The coldness of outer space is a sharp contrast to the warmth-filled memories of your time on Kerbin's shores.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You do a somersault and a back-flip from the hatch onto the side of the ship. How do you like THAT KSC?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Here you are, crossing the gulf between the stars. Much like the ancient sailors who braved the journey across the seas.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, look at that view. Now if only we could figure out how to pack snacks in these suits.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float above the bleak terrain in your EVA suit your mind wanders, as it often does, to snacks. Yummy, yummy snacks!
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder why so much ice is built up around each pole...then again, you can't really think of a better place for it.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The view of the mountains below is much clearer when you're not looking through the window of a spaceship.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wave in the general direction of Kerbin. Hi Tundra! Bye Tundra!
