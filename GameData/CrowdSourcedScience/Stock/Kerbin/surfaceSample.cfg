        KerbinSrfLandedWater* = You seem to have captured a small crustacean. Mission Control is less than impressed.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater* = The land surface near the water contains high amounts of water, salt and seaweed.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You wonder why you put on a two-million-dollar spacesuit and got into a multi-billion dollar rocket just to pick up some dirt.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = Yep. Looks like dirt.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = Beautiful green grass.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = Yep. Still dirt.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = This is some quality grass.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = I didn't sign up for this.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = An incredibly long, furry, purple creature slithers bizarrely out of the grass. You rub your eyes and when you look again there is nothing in sight.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = I got a jar o' dirt! I got a jar o' dirt!
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You pick at the dirt and discover a worm under the grass. You promptly name him Kelbin and attempt to hug him but end up squishing him in your arms. You feel bad so you open up a container and gently place him inside.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You notice that someone may have planted onions here once.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = Years of training has brought kerbalkind here, to find this handful of soil! You hope you won't be fired for that.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = The substance contains a remarkable amount of organic material. Excited, you inform Mission Control of this fact, but they seem less than thrilled.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You pick a likely-looking plant to put in a pot and be your companion as you journey across the stars.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands* = You try to taste the ground, but realize that that would be silly. You kiss it instead, happy to be here alive, for once.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = Dirt, grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a ground breaking discovery.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = You discover dried out straw, lichens, and moss.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = You find a tiny fleck of a shiny yellow material among the rocks. It seems that there is gold in these hills.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands* = The rocks here are far more interesting than the ones you find elsewhere. You pick up a few to add to your rock collection.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = You pick up a small creature with far too many legs. Mission control denies your request to keep it as a pet.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = You take a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = You scoop up some watery sand and decide the best use for it is to build a sand castle.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = Hey look, a wristwatch! Finders, keepers!
        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = You build a sand castle, then take a sample of it. It's sand.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores* = You pick up a particularly nice-looking seashell and add it to your personal collection. The not-so-nice ones you send to Mission Control.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains* = The rock sample you pry from the mountainside seems prouder than all your other rock samples. As if it knows that it was part of something unimaginably greater.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains* = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains* = The air is thin, the climate is frigid, and the ground is impenetrable.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you're in a climate-controlled suit, because it sure looks hot out there.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = Sand, sand, and more sand. A rock adds some badly needed variety to the landscape.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = You saw a blue box on the horizon, but it was just an illusion. Also, you picked up a stone.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = You remember your wilderness survival training... wait, do you need that training in space? What are you doing here in the desert? Someone is going to answer for this.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts* = You build a sand castle to establish your dominance over the desert and demand that all nearby sand creatures swear fealty.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = The grass here is definitely not as green as it is in other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called the Badlands makes you feel cool.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = Rock, coal, and dead plant matter make up the sample.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands* = Your surface sample tries to bite you.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra* = You scoop up some snow. Half goes in the bag while the other half flies towards Bob's head at a respectable velocity.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra* = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra* = You remind yourself to take a surface sample before relieving yourself.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra* = The ground here is partially frozen and tufts of moose hair cover the matted grass.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = This ice is not very solid, the ice caps are melting. 
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = As you analyse the sample, you see a massive chunk of ice break off. You want to leave.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = You are amazed at how much microscopic life is contained within the piece of frozen water currently in your hands.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = This ice is not very solid, indicating that the ice caps are melting. 
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps* = As you analyse the sample, you see a massive chunk of ice break off in the distance. You want to leave.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf* = You pick up a piece of ice and lick it. It tastes cold and vaguely salty.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf* = You take a sample of the ice. Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf* = You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the cracking sounds. You try to not think back on how you landed here.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf* = Even the top layer of ice is hard and glassy, and digging out a chunk takes a lot of effort.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf* = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf* = As you drill for a sample, you remember hearing from one of the scientists that the ice is very fragile this year, and then try to forget about it.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = You scoop up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample, you hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = There seems to be a lot of a liquid substance. Surely this will be a huge advancement in science as we know it.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = This material seems to take on the shape of what looks like a Kerbin container. More study is needed.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = You make sure to include some plankton in your sample for the folks back at KSC.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = Curious - something essential to life that isn't green, isn't explosive, and doesn't start with "K".
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = "Di-hydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater* = You somehow managed to catch a fish. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit in your pocket.

        KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands* = At least this bottle of murky water will be useful for a water quality analysis.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands* =

        KerbinSrfSplashedShores* = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores* = The water has a lot of sand in it, likely related to the nearby beach.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores* = The sharks are circling. You pointedly try to ignore this as you collect some water for quality analysis.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores* = "Di-hydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"

        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains* =

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts* = It looks like your normal gritty water. But this is no ordinary gritty water. It's desert water, and it's worth its weight in....well, water really.
        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts* = A brief chemical analysis of the water reveals high amounts of minerals associated with ancient fossil groundwater, presumably rained during wetter times aeons ago.

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands* = The water will have cooled by the time it gets back, but it's still full of silt and dust.

        KerbinSrfSplashedTundra* = Looks like normal water to you, perhaps with a faint peaty tinge.

        KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps* = The water might be freezing, but it's still teeming with microscopic life.

        KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf* = The water is salty and contains particles of ice.

        KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf* = There's a large chunk of ice in it, so you have to grind it up before it fits in the tube with the water.
