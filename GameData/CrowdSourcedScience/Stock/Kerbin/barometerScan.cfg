        KerbinSrfLandedWater = Hopefully the folks back at KSC can use this barometer data to warn you of an incoming storm.
        KerbinSrfLandedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.

        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = A blade of grass gets caught in the outer casing of the sensor, and obstructs your view of the display. Oh well, we'll just make something up. They'll never know anyway.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you painstakingly jot down the data, you wonder why you couldn't just take it from the morning news weather report.
        KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Looks like a fine day today on Kerbin's plains.

        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You make adjustments to the barometer to get an accurate reading at such a high altitude. Hopefully they appreciate your work back at KSC.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Barometer data indicates higher-than-normal humidity and precipitation. You guess that's just what happens when you're closer to the sky.
        KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The barometer indicates an incoming storm! You feel sorry for anyone living in the valleys of the Highlands.

        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The barometric pressure here is high, but you are more interested in sneaking a glance at the bathing suits on the beach.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = You send the barometer data back to KSC and reminisce about the good times you have had on these same beaches.
        KerbinSrfLandedShores = The barometer's dial moves left and right as you watch the surf batter the shores.

        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The barometer reads very low here. You aren't surprised, as the mountaintop nearly pierces the clouds.
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You stand on your tiptoes and try to insert the barometer into a passing cloud. So close...
        KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The air pressure is dropping precipitously. Much like that goat that just fell off the mountain.

        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Barometer reads very high. No rain in sight. In fact you wonder if it has EVER rained here.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's not going to rain for a long time.
        KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Readings here are the same as usual: high. Nothing else to report.

        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor looks like it went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You transmit the readings. Mission Control immediately calls you back and demands to know if you are still on Kerbin.
        KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You think that the barometer is broken but you're too scared to go outside and fix it.

        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You don't think that this would be a nice place to live. The barometer concurs.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The barometer seems extremely high here. You can almost feel the pressure squeezing the ship.
        KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The barometer suggests the area has a prevalence towards blizzards. Might not be a good idea to stay here much longer.

        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
        KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Atmospheric pressure is fairly high in the polar regions. Perhaps the scientists back at KSC can explain why.

        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The air pressure data spells out "COLD". You concur with the computer.
        KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Pressure is higher here on average, as per usual for polar regions.

        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = Atmospheric pressure is the same as at sea level, even though you're no...wait a minute...
        KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The labels on the barometer are covered with ice, and somebody forgot to install an equipment heater.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer reading isn't very interesting so you look out the window and watch the waves instead.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Surprisingly all the water didn't short out the instrument, and you are able to get a good reading to send back to KSC.
        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You wish there was a setting on the barometer that warns you of sharks.

        KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = A drifting stick bumps repeatedly aginst the sensor and causes the needle to move crazily.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedHighlands =

        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Data from the barometer seems to indicate a storm within the next few hours. You wonder if you'll get to see a shipwreck. You hope it's not yours.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Drops of saltwater seem to have encrusted the barometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading. You make something up randomly, and send it back to KSC.
        KerbinSrfSplashedShores = As you write down the air pressure data you are briefly reminded of your elementary science lessons about 'The Water Cycle'.

        //KerbinSrfSplashedMountains =

        KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Looks like there won't be rain for a long time. You wonder how this water got here.

        KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = The water really doesn't help the havoc the Badlands plays on the instrumentation.

        KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = The cold water causes air to sink downwards, increasing the air pressure.

        KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = The dial is stuck. You're too busy freezing to care.

        KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf = Waves of icy water washing over the sensor generate bursts of pressure.

        KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf = Looks like a severe polar storm will arrive later.

        KerbinFlyingLow = The pressure is lower here than it was at ground level.
        KerbinFlyingLow = After several minutes of displaying nothing, the sensor briefly registers a value!
        KerbinFlyingLow = One Hundred Million Pascals. That can't be right.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You remember that barometers are often used to forecast the weather. You examine the readings and decide that it might not be a good idea to be here in the next few hours.
        KerbinFlyingLow = The dial keeps spinning round and round. After consulting with Mission Control, you scribble a zero at the end of each of the measurements. The dial immediately points to the largest one.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Instead of sending Mission Control your barometer data, you just send them a copy of this morning's weather report.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Barometric pressure: 300 millibars. Or is that 3000? Whatever....look at the view down there.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Your blood pressure rises as you see just how close you are flying to the terrain below. The barometric pressure, in contrast, remains steady.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Despite the fact that you are flying low over the surface, the reading is no lower than usual.
        KerbinFlyingLow = *singing* "Under pressure. Ba da dum, ba da da dum, Ba da da dum, ba da da dum. Under pressure".
        KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer shakes and shimmies so much in the atmosphere that you are unable to get an accurate reading.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Readings seem nominal. Snack time!
        KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer seems to be questioning its own existence. Well, at least you agree on something.
        KerbinFlyingLow = You wonder what a desert storm would look like.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
        KerbinFlyingLow = Pressure readings are more or less in line with the rest of Kerbin. Much unlike the Highlands themselves.

        KerbinFlyingHigh = There is still atmospheric pressure even this far from the surface.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Did the device malfunction, or is this not a 'true' vacuum?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Glancing at the display, you shake your head and feel sorry for anyone who lives down there.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = "The weather will remain pleasant," declares the barometer.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it snack time yet? It has to be snack time. No pressure readings till after snack time.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The air is too thin for the barometer to function. Much like how the air is too cold for a kerbal to function.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer is covered in ice crystals at this altitude, and you are unable to get a good reading. Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Despite the fact that you are flying high over the surface, the reading is no higher than usual.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = In the thin, wispy layers of the upper atmosphere a barometer reading is not particularly useful. You take the reading anyway and send it back to KSC.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer data you transmit back to KSC barely qualifies as a proper reading.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = Pressure is nominal. Nothing to see here folks. Move along.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer here seems nominal. What's not nominal is the amount of snacks we haven't eaten yet. You radio KSC about this issue.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The display gives very little indication that you're flying over a desert.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = High over the terrain you take a barometric reading. Doesn't matter, as the instrument seems to read the same thing everywhere. Why did we bring this stupid instrument anyway?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = High above the shore you scribble yet another note on the barometric pressure, thinking about all the Kerbals sunning themselves below.

        KerbinInSpaceLow = You don't bother to look at the display. The fact that you're in space tells you all you need to know.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = It reads -3. Huh, that's funny. Oh well, they can figure it out back at KSC.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = At this altitude, a barometer scan is almost purely a formality.
        KerbinInSpaceLow = You have discovered that there is no air in space.

        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Whatever vestiges of the atmosphere that might have lingered in low orbit are long gone.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Why are you wasting your time doing barometry in a vacuum when you could be doing something fun instead, like a spacewalk?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = Aw hell, this is useless.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The needle is above zero. Tapping it, it climbs higher. You make a note to request the barometer be calibrated properly next time.
