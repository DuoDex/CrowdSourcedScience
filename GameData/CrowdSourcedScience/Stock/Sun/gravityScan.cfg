    %RESULTS
    {
        SunInSpaceLow = The gravitational pull is very high. Maybe that's why the planets don't fly away?
		SunInSpaceLow = The manufacturer's manual for this instrument has classified readings in this range as "very unwise". There is a somewhat unhelpful footnote that the warranty does not cover melting.
		SunInSpaceLow = The readings are so far off the scale that the dial loops back around to 1.

		SunInSpaceHigh = You look at the small measurement, and feel slightly relieved. Perhaps you won't be incinerated today.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You stare at the reading. And stare. And stare.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The sensor monitors the orbital dynamics of the planets.
