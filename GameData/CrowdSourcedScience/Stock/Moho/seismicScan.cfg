        MohoSrfLanded = A small rumble shakes the cockpit before you can access the sensor.

        //MohoSrfLandedNorthPole =

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = The sensor picks up anomalous vibrations from deep within the planet. You wonder what could be down there.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = Despite the tremendous heat of the sun, thermal expansion isn't causing any noteworthy movement.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Thermal expansion from the sun is causing geological activity.

        //MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands =

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The meter shows the maximum amount of force needed to jiggle Jebediah's love-handles for a fortnight.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands = This place seems much calmer than you would think. Tests indicate that there hasn't been any geologic activity in billions of years.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = The shaking of the needle reminds you how cold the dark side of this planet gets.

        //MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands =
        //MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands =

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon = There is a strong anomaly in the sensor that you can't determine the cause of. After much deliberation, you decide to ignore it.

        //MohoSrfLandedSouthPole =
