        MohoSrfLanded = Moho's gravity and density implies that a metal-rich core occupies at least 60% of the planet's mass, a figure twice as great as for Kerbin!
        MohoSrfLanded = The gravitational pull of this planet is high for one of its size. The core must be extremely dense.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Detailed scans hint at hollow space in the interior of the planet.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands = The gravity beneath the instrument shifts almost imperceptibly.

        MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity is stable here.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = The sensor is giving odd readings here.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The gravity is quite consistent here.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = Detailed scans hint at hollow spaces in the interior of the planet.
