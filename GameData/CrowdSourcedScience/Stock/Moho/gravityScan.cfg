        MohoSrfLanded* = Moho's gravity and density implies that a metal-rich core occupies at least 60% of the planet's mass, a figure twice as great as for Kerbin!
        MohoSrfLanded* = The gravitational pull of this planet is high for one of its size. The core must be extremely dense.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthPole* = Detailed scans hint at hollow space in the interior of the planet.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands* = The gravity beneath the instrument shifts almost imperceptibly.

        MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands* = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands* = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands* = The gravity is stable here.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters* = The sensor is giving odd readings here.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands* = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands* = The gravimeter confirms that the lowlands are large.

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon* = The gravity is quite consistent here.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole* = Detailed scans hint at hollow spaces in the interior of the planet.
