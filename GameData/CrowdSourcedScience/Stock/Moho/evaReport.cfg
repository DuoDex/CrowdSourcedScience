        MohoSrfLanded* = At least you will have a nice tan when you get home.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthPole* = The thermal systems of your suit protest as you move around in the bright sunlight. It's really hot out here.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge* = So... Anything interesting around here?

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole* = Such heat, wow.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands* = You realize you forgot to bring your sunglasses.

        MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands* = You trip over a small rock. Fortunately the gravity is low enough that you aren't hurt.

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands* = You are relieved to see that spacesuits have an SPF of one million.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands* = You contemplate sun bathing for your return publicity shots.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters* = There's a hole around here somewhere.
        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters* = Look! There's water on Moho! Oh, wait... that's just sweat that got on your visor.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands* = Gene was skeptical, but you're glad you brought an umbrella.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands* = Suddenly, you really want some ice cream. You ask mission control for the fastest transfer window to Minmus.

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon* = You can hear the coolant rushing through the tubes in your suit as fast as it can, and decide that you'd really like to go back inside.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole* = You hope to find the exact point of the south pole. Then you can plant a flag. But mission control might have other plans....

        MohoInSpaceLow* = You can actually feel the radiation.

        MohoInSpaceLowNorthPole* = You pull out a energy bar, before realizing that you can't get it through your helmet. You compromise by smearing it on the visor.

        MohoInSpaceLowNorthernSinkholeRidge* = The ridge looks like the lips of an enormous mouth.

        MohoInSpaceLowNorthernSinkhole* = That's a deep, dark hole down there. You've heard legends of a Kraken, and wonder if this is its den.

        MohoInSpaceLowMidlands* = It's really bright this close to Kerbol. You wonder if Dyson Spheres could be made by Kerbalkind.

        MohoInSpaceLowWesternLowlands* = You feel dehydrated, but your suit says you're fine.

        MohoInSpaceLowCentralLowlands* = The scientists back home want to know if life could exist here. You decide that they should've come instead.

        MohoInSpaceLowHighlands* = You draw a house in the dust. You're pretty sure the rocket will cover it up during launch, though.
        MohoInSpaceLowHighlands* = You hope you're high enough that you don't hit any mountains.

        MohoInSpaceLowMinorCraters* = Are there many asteroids around? Any asteroid that made those craters could do a real number on a Kerbal.

        MohoInSpaceLowSouthWesternLowlands* = It looks like the ship is covered in pollen. No, wait, it's just dust.

        //MohoInSpaceLowSouthEasternLowlands* =

        MohoInSpaceLowCanyon* = You can almost feel the radiation.

        MohoInSpaceLowSouthPole* = Surely you're safe from the Kraken here.

        MohoInSpaceHigh* = Stepping out of the shadow is like walking into a furnace.
