        //MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge =

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = The thermal gradient data forms a very pretty chart.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands = With every fan in the pod on, you don't need a thermometer to tell you it's hot.

        //MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands =

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = Temperature in the shadow seems to be quite low.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature here is so hot the thermometer has melted entirely. No matter, you send the data back anyway.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = The experiment is a success! The team predicted there would be numbers in the data!

        //MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands =
        //MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands =

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The melted thermometer makes you question the safety of this mission.

        //MohoSrfLandedSouthPole =

        MohoInSpaceLow = You guessed it would be at least a million billion degrees this close to the Sun... but it isn't.
        MohoInSpaceLow = This wasn't tested for such temperatures.

        //MohoInSpaceHigh =
