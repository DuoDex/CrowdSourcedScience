        MohoSrfLanded = Yup, its a chunk of Moho.
        MohoSrfLanded = Despite your belief you realize that Moho is in fact not a giant cookie. You hope you brought some medication.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = The ground is made up of old lava flows, suggesting periods of intense volcanic activity.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = The sample shows signs of sodium, potassium and hydroxide. These are great resources for life support.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = Ahah! You spot a familiar-looking rock a couple of meters away from you. It reminds you of the snack pack you've just eaten.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Rocks lying around seem to be ejecta from volcanic eruptions.

        MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands = You perform an analysis of the local soil composition.

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The sample shows signs of scorch marks and intense heat, but you already knew that.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands = The sample is very brittle and is covered with micro-cracks. It suggests that a super-heated atmosphere may have once existed here.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = Rocks all look the same to you. Wishing you had taken that geology course back on Kerbin, you try to break some stones by hitting them hard against each other. They seem to be very sturdy and don't break at all.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands = The sample reveals complex artificial polymers, often used in reinforced fabrics and plastics.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands = Get this to the lab, stat!

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The sample shows signs of past volcanic activity.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = This will make a great gift for little Werner Von Kerman Jr.!
