        MohoSrfLanded* = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthPole* = Grey rocks and grey dirt. What a *great* location!

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge* = You gaze in amazement at the sinkhole and wonder how it formed. You decide it was probably just an oversight.

        MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole* = You ponder the mystery of where Moho's atmosphere went. You're glad it doesn't have one anymore, because that would make coming back really hard.

        MohoSrfLandedMidlands* = Sure is hot in here.

        MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands* = You decide that it's hard to be an explorer.

        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands* = The crew considers which snacks would taste best if cooked.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands* = You haven't been this hot since that day in training when your suit caught fire. You worry about it happening again.

        MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters* = Jeb wants to know if a rover would powerslide here. Badly.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands* = You wonder how much ore could be mined here. You tell mission control that the mining rights are yours.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands* = Sure is lonely here on Moho.

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon* = It appears the heat shielding is melting. The Kerbals are sweating and hot.

        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole* = This pole is much less interesting.
        MohoSrfLandedSouthPole* = You look for a big hole in the ground. Is this the wrong pole?

        MohoInSpaceLow* = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
        MohoInSpaceLow* = After some arguments with mission control you come to the conclusion that Moho is a giant cookie.

        MohoInSpaceHigh* = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
        MohoInSpaceHigh* = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
        MohoInSpaceHigh* = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
