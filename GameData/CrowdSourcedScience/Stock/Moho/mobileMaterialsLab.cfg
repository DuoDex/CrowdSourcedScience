        MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands* = The racks holding the samples melt in a highly interesting fashion.

        MohoSrfLandedHighlands* = The samples start sweating.

        MohoSrfLandedCanyon* = The samples have taken well to Moho and are now brown.

        //MohoSrfLandedSouthPole* =

        MohoInSpaceLow* = Some of the samples suggest Moho has a weak magnetic field.

        MohoInSpaceHigh* = The materials have been affected by the intense heat and many of the softer ones have melted entirely.
