    {
        BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks = I can see Kerbin from here! I wish I had a telescope...
        BopSrfLandedPeaks = Mission Control tells you that the amazing vista you see is just an optical illusion. You take some picture anyway.

        BopSrfLandedRidges = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.

        BopSrfLandedPoles = You're not sure why, but this place gives you an eerie feeling.

        BopSrfLandedSlopes = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.

        BopSrfLandedValley = You smell squid. The pilot must be eating sushi. What else could it be?

        BopInSpaceLow = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
        BopInSpaceLow = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
        BopInSpaceLow = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it's hiding some dark secret...
        BopInSpaceLow = That mountain high enough to hit you. You hope you are landing.
        BopInSpaceLow = Last time we went to Gilly, we did not come back... oh? This is Bop?

        BopInSpaceHigh = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because youâ€™ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
        BopInSpaceHigh = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can't help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
        BopInSpaceHigh = Stuck in an eccentric, inclined orbit, this rock offers nothing to look at. A complete waste of time.
        BopInSpaceHigh = Bop looks remarkably like a potato from this height.
        BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control informs you that that no, that is not a potato outside your window.
        BopInSpaceHigh = You realize that that mountain is remarkably high.
