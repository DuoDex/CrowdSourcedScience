        BopSrfLanded = The seismometer briefly goes off the charts, then seems to decide that Bop is geologically dead.
        BopSrfLanded = Some vibrations have been detected under your vessel. You start to think about the creepy stories your friends have told you.
        BopSrfLanded = Bop seems to be impacted often... what is hitting it?

        BopSrfLandedPeaks = The small moon is resonating with an odd musical frequency. Hooking the sensor feed up to some speakers, you recognize it as a toccata.

        BopSrfLandedRidges = The planet gives off steady quakes which grow in intensity as Vall passes; as it leaves, they settle down again. This would be expected if the other moons did the same.

        BopSrfLandedPoles = There are subtle vibrations that cannot be explained by Bop's physical characteristics.

        BopSrfLandedSlopes = How can it be that Bop is this rock-steady for such a small moon?

        BopSrfLandedValley = Among all the shakes and jitters, you notice a continual pulsing pattern. It makes you feel uneasy.
