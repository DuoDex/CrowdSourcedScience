        BopSrfLanded = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
        BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there's something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks = The low gravity is counterbalanced by a strong attraction to Jool. It is very green.
		BopSrfLandedPeaks = Mission Control tells you not to take off your helmet.

        BopSrfLandedRidges = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.

        BopSrfLandedPoles = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.

        BopSrfLandedSlopes = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it's probably just your suit being out of order.

        BopSrfLandedValley = You look around at the tops of the round lumps around you and think you see a small flash in the distance. You put down "weird" in the mission report.

        BopInSpaceLowPeaks = I wish that we were not here.
		BopInSpaceLowPeaks = I can see the ship from up here!

		BopInSpaceHigh = The moon strikingly resembles a potato.
        BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control tells you that Bop is that little brown thing. You had gone on EVA to move it away from the ship.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Bop looks disturbingly like Gilly. You hope you will be able to make it home this time.
