    {
        BopSrfLanded* = Just under the brown surface you analyze a black, glassy material. A volcanic mineral called obsidian.
        BopSrfLanded* = You analyze a red-brown mineral. It appears to be hard and very moist, like rusty iron.
        BopSrfLanded* = You pick up an orange mineral. It appears to be soft and very moist.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks* = Just under the brown surface you find a black, glassy material and put it in the sample bag. A volcanic residue perhaps?

        BopSrfLandedRidges* = The soil here is surprisingly soft, like play-koh.

        BopSrfLandedPoles* = As you take a sample, it begins to glow... and starts shaking. It clearly does not like being contained.

        BopSrfLandedSlopes* = You pick up a rock from the ground. It looks somewhat unusual so you put it into the container.

        BopSrfLandedValley* = The rocks lying around look very dull and in no way remind you of potatoes. You shove one into your sample container, just to pass time.
