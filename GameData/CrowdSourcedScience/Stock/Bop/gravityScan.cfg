        BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location... wait, it's gone now.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner seems split between Jool and Bop. You put it down to a defect.
        BopSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner refuses to point at Bop. After frantic calls to the manufacturer, Mission Control tells you that it is rated to high.

        //BopSrfLandedRidges =

        BopSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        //BopSrfLandedSlopes =

        BopSrfLandedValley = You get weird results. Something seems Krakeny...

        BopInSpaceLowPeaks = The peaks seem rather close. The gravity scanner agrees.
        BopInSpaceLowPeaks = Scanning returns a result of "0".

        //BopInSpaceLowRidges =
        //BopInSpaceLowPoles =
        //BopInSpaceLowSlopes =
        //BopInSpaceLowValley =

        BopInSpaceHigh = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.

        BopInSpaceHighPeaks = The scanner is still pointing at Jool.
        BopInSpaceHighPeaks = What does this "%NaN%" mean? Mission Control tells you to watch out for Krakens.

        //BopInSpaceHighRidges =
        //BopInSpaceHighPoles =
        //BopInSpaceHighSlopes =
        //BopInSpaceHighValley =
