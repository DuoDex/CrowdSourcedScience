    {
        MinmusSrfLanded = You have confirmed that the surface does not taste like mint ice cream.
        MinmusSrfLanded = The powdery substance on the surface gets kicked up with every step, you swat at it as it pelts your visor.
        MinmusSrfLanded = You order the engineers to start building a "wicked fast rover" to race on the Flats at once.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = It is hard to control your movements in the low gravity.
        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The ground beneath you has the perfect consistency for snowballs. Sadly, you cannot find a worthy target.

        MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = You spend several minutes contemplating how to taste the ground without removing your space suit's helmet before giving up.

        MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = You look up at the highlands and wonder out loud whether you could jump over them. Mission Control advises you not to try.

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = As far as you can tell in the low gravity, the ground is firm underfoot, and not as slippery as you had expected.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = You think you could drill some holes here and play golf... space golf, of course.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = As you exit your craft, you utter the words; "It's one small step for Kerbals, one giant leap for Kerbalkind."

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = Engine's exhaust seems to have melted the ice underneath.

        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = You can feel the planet spinning beneath you. Suddenly, you feel a little green around the gills.

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = You wonder how far you could slide down this hill...
        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = You start to jury-rig a sled from spare parts, only to be interrupted by orders from Mission Control.
        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = You could have sworn you saw a little boy and a tiger sledding down the hill in a toboggan. You check your O2 supply... Ah! Just hypoxia.

        MinmusInSpaceLow = The mesmerizing aquamarine flats almost make you forget to keep one hand on the ship's handle at all times.

        MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = The surface seems to be a mixture of rock and ice... you wonder if it could be mined for fuel.

        //MinmusInSpaceLowMidlands =

        MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands = You are craving mint ice cream right about now.

        MinmusInSpaceLowFlats = These ice lakes are so flat and smooth, you suspect they would make an excellent drag strip.

        MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats = If the spaceship fails, you could probably use the jetpack to get back into orbit.

        MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats = You need to do something about the lack of snacks here.

        MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats = The low gravity would make driving around difficult.

        //MinmusInSpaceLowPoles =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes =

        MinmusInSpaceHigh = It looks so small, and yet so delicious.
