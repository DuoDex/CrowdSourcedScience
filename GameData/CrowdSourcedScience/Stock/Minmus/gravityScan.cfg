        MinmusSrfLanded = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands =
        //MinmusSrfLandedLowlands =

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = The gravity readings dash your hopes - based on its size, Minmus is far too dense to be made of ice cream.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.

        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope. Why did we land here again?

        //MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowMidlands =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowPoles =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes =

        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.

        //MinmusInSpaceHighHighlands =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighMidlands =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighLowlands =

        MinmusInSpaceHighFlats = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.

        //MinmusInSpaceHighGreatFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighGreaterFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighLesserFlats =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighPoles =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighSlopes =
