        MinmusSrfLanded* = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands* = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands* =
        //MinmusSrfLandedLowlands* =

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats* = The gravity readings dash your hopes - based on its size, Minmus is far too dense to be made of ice cream.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats* = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats* = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.

        MinmusSrfLandedPoles* = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes* = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope. Why did we land here again?

        //MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowMidlands* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowPoles* =
        //MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes* =

        MinmusInSpaceHigh* = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.

        //MinmusInSpaceHighHighlands* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighMidlands* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighLowlands* =

        MinmusInSpaceHighFlats* = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.

        //MinmusInSpaceHighGreatFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighGreaterFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighLesserFlats* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighPoles* =
        //MinmusInSpaceHighSlopes* =
    }
