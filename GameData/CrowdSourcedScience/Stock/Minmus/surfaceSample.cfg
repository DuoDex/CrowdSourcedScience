        MinmusSrfLanded = As you gather up some Minmus material, you label it as "Definitely not ice".
        MinmusSrfLanded = You scoop a sample up to be analyzed back home, then smear some over your gloves to sniff when you get back in the capsule. You bet it'll smell minty and delicious.
        MinmusSrfLanded = You taste the sample, and find that it does not taste like mint at all. You wonder where the medicine cabinet went.
        MinmusSrfLanded = You are disappointed to discover that the sample does not taste like ice cream, but instead tastes more like frozen yogurt.
        MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control tentatively asks you how it tastes.
        MinmusSrfLanded = After excavating the surface, you find a hidden ice layer. The ice appears to have a slightly greenish tinge to it. Upon further examination, you find it to have the perfect consistency for snow-cones, yet the taste leaves much to be desired.
        MinmusSrfLanded = You try to taste the sample but your helmet gets in the way.
        MinmusSrfLanded = The white mountains have a snow-like surface. The frozen lakes seem to be made of the same substance, but much smoother.
        MinmusSrfLanded = Must... not... taste...
        MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
        MinmusSrfLanded = Surface samples confirm that it is not made out of mint, even though it looks and tastes like it.
        MinmusSrfLanded = You ask Mission Control if the substance could be marketed as some sort of air freshener. They consider your request.
        MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = Ice up here has a very high reflectivity, which must significantly contribute to the high albedo of Minmus.

        MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = You realize that the ground here looks more like cookie dough then the mint ice cream on the flat lands. Your mouth starts to water.
        MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = The sample you've taken indicates that the surface is made from different types of snow and ice intricately intermixed with each other.

        MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = You take a handful of snow, ice, and dirt and put it into your sample bag. You hope the science team on Kerbin will figure out what it is and why it's not suitable for Kerbal consumption.

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = You want to get your helmet off and taste the sample. instead, you pull yourself together and continue with the mission.
        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The surface is perfectly flat and smooth. You have to use your shovel to dig out some ice.
        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The ground appears to be made of small, cyan crystals. It doesn't look like it would be enjoyable walking barefoot here.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = It's just ice, with occasional snowflakes here and there.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The sample consists of multiple layers of very reflective greenish ice. You wonder what compound gives it such a nice colour.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The sample contains several distinct types of ice frozen to form a complex, multi-layered pattern.

        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = You see that The Goo has formed itself into a ice cream cone, You note how yummy it looks.
        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The surface here looks even tastier than everywhere else.
        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = It has the consistency of a snowball, and is likely to be just as good at being thrown into other Kerbals' faces.

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = It's snow, ice, some loose dirt, and a couple of pebbles, frozen together in a strangely complicated way.
