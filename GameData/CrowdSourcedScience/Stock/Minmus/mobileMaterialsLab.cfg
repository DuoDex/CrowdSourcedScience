    {
        MinmusSrfLanded* = Bacterial samples appear to gorge themselves on what looks like microscopic mint scones.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands* = Some of the surface dust reacts with the metal samples to produce an aquamarine rust.

        MinmusSrfLandedMidlands* = The samples appear to have set up a communist government. You are not sure how you can tell.

        //MinmusSrfLandedLowlands* =

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats* = As you open the doors a sample dashes past to taste the surface.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats* = The low temperature has frozen one of the liquid samples into a sort of iced cream. Was it green before?

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats* = Some of the biological samples have not fared well. The metals, however, appear to be doing just fine.

        //MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats* =
        //MinmusSrfLandedPoles* =

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes* = Mission Control informs you that you have to put on safety goggles before doing any experiments. You fail to fit them on your helmet, and Mission Control reponds by telling you to immediately abort the mission.

        //MinmusInSpaceLow* =

        MinmusInSpaceHigh* = The samples react to the lack of an atmosphere.
