        MinmusSrfLanded = Bacterial samples appear to gorge themselves on what looks like microscopic mint scones.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = Some of the surface dust reacts with the metal samples to produce an aquamarine rust.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands =
        //MinmusSrfLandedLowlands =

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = As you open the doors a sample dashes past to taste the surface.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = The low temperature has frozen one of the liquid samples into a sort of iced cream. Was it green before?

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Some of the biological samples have not fared well. The metals, however, appear to be doing just fine.

        //MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats =
        //MinmusSrfLandedPoles =
        //MinmusSrfLandedSlopes =

        //MinmusInSpaceLow =

        MinmusInSpaceHigh = The samples react to the lack of an atmosphere.
