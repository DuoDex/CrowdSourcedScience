    {
        MinmusSrfLanded = You detect some seismic activity, most likely caused by tidal forces.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The lake beds rumble periodically. Perhaps the tidal forces are causing heating under all that ice.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands =
        //MinmusSrfLandedLowlands =

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = You detect somewhat violent shuddering somewhere on the opposite side of Minmus. It was likely caused by a small meteorite impact.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = You watch the data as it clearly shows that nothing interesting is happening at all.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The seismometer detects some minor quakes, and what sounds like bubbling. Perhaps these areas are resurfaced by occasional geological activity.
        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = A large impact nearby sends shockwaves throughout the planet. This is a perfect opportunity to map the interior!

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The vibrations indicate there's some rock under all that ice.

        //MinmusSrfLandedPoles =

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = A boulder rolling down the neighboring slope interferes with your readings.
        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = There's a lot of static on the sensor feed. Are we sliding down the hill?
