        MinmusSrfLanded = You secretly wish the temperature were hot enough to cause you to sweat. You packed extra ice cream for the occasion.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = As you suspected, it's very cold here.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands =

        MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh". You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks.

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN. One of the wires must have come loose again.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = The ground seems to reflect most of the Sun's thermal energy, yet the ground temperature is much higher than it should be. This warrants further investigation.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The temperature reading suggests that this area might be made of ice cream. Acquiring a surface sample is highly recommended.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.

        //MinmusSrfLandedPoles =
        //MinmusSrfLandedSlopes =

        MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus is cold, ice cream is cold. Coincidence? You hope not!

        //MinmusInSpaceHigh =
