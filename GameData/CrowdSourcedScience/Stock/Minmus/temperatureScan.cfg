        MinmusSrfLanded* = You secretly wish the temperature were hot enough to cause you to sweat. You packed extra ice cream for the occasion.

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands* = As you suspected, it's very cold here.

        //MinmusSrfLandedMidlands* =

        MinmusSrfLandedLowlands* = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh". You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks.

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats* = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN. One of the wires must have come loose again.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats* = The ground seems to reflect most of the Sun's thermal energy, yet the ground temperature is much higher than it should be. This warrants further investigation.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats* = The temperature reading suggests that this area might be made of ice cream. Acquiring a surface sample is highly recommended.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats* = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.

        //MinmusSrfLandedPoles* =
        //MinmusSrfLandedSlopes* =

        MinmusInSpaceLow* = Minmus is cold, ice cream is cold. Coincidence? You hope not!

        //MinmusInSpaceHigh* =
