        MinmusSrfLanded = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...

        MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The curvature of Minmus is easily visible from here.

        MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = Low gravity and interesting terrain visible from the window invite you to come outside.

        MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder why are you still sitting in your capsule while there's so much fun to have outside.

        MinmusSrfLandedFlats = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = You note that landing on a perfectly flat surface is somewhat boring.

        MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The ground here is completely flat. It's really boring.

        MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = "I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space."

        MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Well, it looks no different from here than it did from far away.

        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = Don't fall over, don't fall over, don't fall over...
        MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = It's completely beyond your understanding why you decided to land here and not on the perfectly flat surface of the frozen lake below.

        MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if it's possible to EVA to the surface and back.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = Jet-packing down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if Minmus tastes of mint, and if you could make a fortune selling tiny edible planets.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You watch Minmus' surface shimmer beneath and wonder if your tongue would stick to the ground upon a thorough licking.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = Here we are. The giant mint in space.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You look out of the window and suddenly feel homesick.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = Let's go back, I saw a cool rock down there.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.

        MinmusInSpaceHigh = You note that your radio fails to transmit when set to the OFF position.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Kerbin looks small. The Mun looks small. Even the Sun looks small. You turn the binoculars the right way round.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Please let it be a sea of lime sherbet.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Well, it's certainly much smaller in person.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = At this distance, Kerbin is little more than a pale blue dot, floating the the inky vastness of space.
        MinmusInSpaceHigh = Hm, how much debris could you kick up if you jumped into one of those lakes from here?
