        VallSrfLanded = This reminds you of Minmus, only bubblegum flavor...
        VallSrfLanded = You analyze the frozen surface and find some blue material.
        VallSrfLanded = You analyze the surface and find some beautiful green and blue crystal structures.

        VallSrfLandedPoles = After crushing some of the surface ice into a snow-cone and getting permission from mission control for an experiment, you find it doesn't taste particularly nice.

        VallSrfLandedMidlands = The icy crystals show signs of shock and sharp temperature change at some point in the past.

        VallSrfLandedHighlands = As you dig into the blue ice, a particularly nasty quake sends your shovel flying. Perhaps you shouldn't dig any deeper...

        VallSrfLandedLowlands = Strangely, some of the ice on the surface seems significantly fresher than the rest.
