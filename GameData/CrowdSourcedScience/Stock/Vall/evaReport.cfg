        VallSrfLanded = The ground rumbles ominously beneath you before you realize that you're just hungry.
        VallSrfLanded = Ice crystals look very shiny.
        VallSrfLanded = You wish you'd brought your ice skates.
        VallSrfLanded = Ice melts down and evaporates from the friction of your space boots. You concentrate very hard on keeping your balance.

        VallSrfLandedPoles = The rocks are of a bluish-green color... Pretty!

        VallSrfLandedMidlands = The surface shivers as the deeper crust buckles and fractures. You want badly to get back inside the ship now.

        VallSrfLandedHighlands = The ground beneath you suddenly lurches, and you hear the sound, carried up through your feet, of immense ice plates scraping against each other.

        VallSrfLandedLowlands = Well, the ice is... thick. You wonder if there's a frozen waterfall somewhere.
