        VallSrfLandedMidlands = This data would be very valuable in advancing science if the screen hadn't iced over.

        VallSrfLandedHighlands = The seismic scan indicates that there is a sudden density change a significant distance below the surface.

        VallSrfLandedLowlands = Wow, what a quake! Something big must have just shifted underground.
