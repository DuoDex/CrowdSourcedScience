        VallSrfLandedHighlands = There is a section below the surface that has a surprisingly high temperature for Vall. Being Vall, of course, it's still quite cold.

        VallInSpaceLow = It's incredibly cold, but every now and then the temperature rises. Plumes of heat must be coming off the moon below.
