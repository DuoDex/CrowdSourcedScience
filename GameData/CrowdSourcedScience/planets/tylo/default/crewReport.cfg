		TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.
		TyloInSpaceLow = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesn't have an atmosphere.
		TyloInSpaceLow = The crew wonders why they even need to land on this miserable rock.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
		TyloInSpaceHigh = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
