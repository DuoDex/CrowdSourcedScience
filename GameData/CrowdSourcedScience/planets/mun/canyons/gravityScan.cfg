		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The data returned by the instrument reveals an ever-so-slight anomaly caused by the Canyons.  Or maybe by your box of snacks.
		MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The gravity readings fluctuate as you move from canyon to flat ground and back to canyon again.
		MunInSpaceHighCanyons = The gravity signature is quite deep here. You suppose that makes sense.
