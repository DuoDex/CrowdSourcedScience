		MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = You keep hoping to see Carey Grant go running through the lab.  No such luck.
		MunInSpaceLow = Experimentation over the Mun has some interesting variances from experimentation above Kerbin.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Solar radiation reflected off the Mun's surface adds an interesting new angle to your science experiments.
