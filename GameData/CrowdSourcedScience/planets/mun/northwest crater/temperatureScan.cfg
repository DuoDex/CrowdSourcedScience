		MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = The inclined angle of the solar radiation at this latitude has a marked effect on the temperature, which you make note of in your report.		
		MunInSpaceLow = You have lost the thermometer. You make up some data with impressive-looking figures to send back to KSC. Bigger numbers are better, right?
