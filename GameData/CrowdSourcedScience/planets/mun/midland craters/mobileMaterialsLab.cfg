		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find it difficult to finish your report with everything at an angle.  There were so many craters around it was impossible to find a level landing site.		
		MunInSpaceLow = You pick a sample at random and subject it to a plethora of scientific examinations including the time-tested method of sticking it in your mouth to see what it tastes like. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = You decide to put off writing your report until you reach the dark side of the Mun. There won't be much to see and you'll be able to concentrate better.
