		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You muse on the chances of having landed in this specific crater.  Oh yeah, we picked it from data from a pre-scan mission. There was a pre-scan mission, right?!		
		MunInSpaceLow = Without atmosphere, weather, or major seismic activity, the Mun's craters are remarkably well-preserved. You make sure to take plenty of pictures and note this in your report.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Ha the Mun is so small and adorab--holy crap, it's getting big really fast.
