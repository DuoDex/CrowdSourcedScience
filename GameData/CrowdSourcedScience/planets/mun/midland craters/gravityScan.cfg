		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The graviolis seem to be resting at the bottom of the craters.  You make a note of this.
		MunInSpaceLowMidLandCraters = You are slowly getting an accurate map of gravitational variances across the munar surface. It's not nearly as uniform as you thought it would be.
		MunInSpaceHighMidlandCraters = Your gravity map is showing the Midland Crates as small anomalies from the general background. Could there be a link between the formation of craters and the Mun's gravitational field?
