		//MunSrfLandedPoles = The graviolis aren't sure whether this is the north or south pole, so they just flow 'down.'		
		MunInSpaceLowPoles = The gravity scanner spits out an impressively long sheet of paper. To your dismay, it's almost entirely filled with numbers.
		MunInSpaceHighPoles = Polar measurement of the Mun's gravitational field? Check! Time for a snack.
