		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = You aren't quite sure of what to make of the lab results.  Guess the scientists back on Kerbin can figure it out.		
		MunInSpaceLow = The materials bay door jams. You give it a few swift kicks until it pops open.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Zero-gravity experiments are messy! You wish there was sort of space vacuum you can use. Your gaze falls on the airlock and something clicks in your head. Hmm...
