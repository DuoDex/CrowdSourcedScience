		MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The lab is cozy with the light reflecting off the crater outside.  You pull out a box of snacks and get to work on it.  Working on the labwork will come later.		
		MunInSpaceLow = There seems to be an argument at Mission Control over which experiment to do first. You sit back and eat some snacks while waiting for them to decide.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your samples seem to be doing well so far on this journey. You wonder if they are as excited as you are to get to the Mun.
