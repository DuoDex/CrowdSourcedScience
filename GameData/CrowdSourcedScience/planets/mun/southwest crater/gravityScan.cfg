		MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The gravity scans here are normal.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.		
		MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = You report a large positive gravitational anomaly over the Southwest Crater. The scientists explain that this is likely due to the basaltic lava flows that filled it in after the impact.
		MunInSpaceHighSouthwestCrater = The gravity scanner has finished printing a black-and-white model of the Mun's gravity field. It looks rather dull so you take out your crayons and start colouring.
