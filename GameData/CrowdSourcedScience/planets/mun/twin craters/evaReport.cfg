		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You really want to jump again, but last time Mission Control yelled at you.
		MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = What an oddly-shaped crater. Are they two different impacts? Or perhaps the result of an impactor hitting at an angle and skipping across the surface.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You could get used to peeing in this suit. Perhaps you should wear it all the time like a badass diaper.
