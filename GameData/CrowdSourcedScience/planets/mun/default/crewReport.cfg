		MunSrfLanded = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = You glance out your window at the surface... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
		MunInSpaceLow = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
		MunInSpaceLow = Looking down at the Mun's surface, you suddenly feel tempted to eat cheese.
		MunInSpaceLow = "Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it's much bigger than we thought it was."
		MunInSpaceLow = Great, we've made it this far! Now, how to land? 
		MunInSpaceLow = Wasn't there an opera written about this once?
		MunInSpaceLow = You don't know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be... interesting.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You are very proud of yourself for reaching this far!
		MunInSpaceHigh = You see a great sphere of moldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
		MunInSpaceHigh = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal's.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You look back at Kerbin. I looks rather small.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It seems that the Mun is one big giant rock with no atmosphere.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Those craters... what could they be caused by?
		MunInSpaceHigh = "Here I am floating in a tin can, far above the Mun."
		MunInSpaceHigh = You wonder if those craters were caused by the impacts of launches before you. Mission Control laughs nervously and urges you otherwise.
