		MunSrfLanded = Done and dusted.
		MunSrfLanded = You take a sample and confirm that the Mun is not made of cheese.
		MunSrfLanded = Wensleydale? Stilton? It isn't like any cheese you've tasted. You wonder if its actually cheese at all.
		MunSrfLanded = You suddenly realize why the physical examination screened for breathing problems.
		MunSrfLanded = Oddly enough, the sample smells similar to Swiss cheese. One wonders if it's edible.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.
		MunSrfLanded = Unfortunately, it's not cheese. You double-check it, but it still isn't.
		MunSrfLanded = You note the sample's lack of cheese.
		MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a grayish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.
		MunSrfLanded = Finally, something that isn't dirt: a rock!
		MunSrfLanded = So, breccias are actually kind of boring.
		MunSrfLanded = Through extensive and professional testing, you find out that, contrary to popular belief, the Mun is not made of cheese. Also, you immediately regret your testing.
		MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
		MunSrfLanded = The lead scientists back at KSP go against your idea to grill your sample between two pieces of bread.
