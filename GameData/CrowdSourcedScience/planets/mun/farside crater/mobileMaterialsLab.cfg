		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Working in a lab in a crater on the moon makes you feel like a mad scientist. You note this in your report.		
		MunInSpaceLow = Your material tests indicate that similar metals brought into contact with one another form a strong bond when in vacuum. That should lead to some interesting developments in spaceflight. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = You finish your lab report in time to catch a glimpse of the huge Farside Crater down below.
