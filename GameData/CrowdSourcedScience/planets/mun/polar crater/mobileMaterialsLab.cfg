		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = All the materials are polarized and sticking together.  Is there ANYTHING that's not difficult in space?!		
		MunInSpaceLow = An experiment in munar orbit, how exciting! You can't wait to see how they compare with the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Laboratory work is lots of fun! You can just leave things floating around instead of putting them away!
