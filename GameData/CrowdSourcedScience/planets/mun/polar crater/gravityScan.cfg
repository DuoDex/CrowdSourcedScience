		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Despite our location the graviolis don't seem to be polarized.		
		MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = The scientists explained that accurate gravitational modelling is critical for ensuring navigation accuracy for future missions. Fine by you, especially if it means getting to go back again.
		MunInSpaceHighPolarCrater = The gravitational anomaly emanated by the huge crater below has actually managed to ever so slightly adjust your orbit.
