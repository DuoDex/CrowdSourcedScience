		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You're not a fan of the name "East Farside Crater". You really hope you land down there so they can name it after you instead.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You wish you brought a skateboard.  Those crater walls would make an awesome halfpipe.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You gave up counting the craters when you ran out of fingers for the ninth time.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You stare through the not-so-vast expanse between you and the Mun.  Who knew it was this big.
