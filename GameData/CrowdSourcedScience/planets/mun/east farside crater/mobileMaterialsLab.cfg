		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = The materials promptly roll down the hill to the lowest part of the crater as soon as you open the canister.  You guess that's why its a 'Mobile Materials' Lab.
		MunInSpaceLow = You are too busy doodling the crater below to finish your lab experiments, so you send the doodle back to KSC instead of your report..
		MunInSpaceLow = After much deliberation, the samples have all agreed that the Mun does not in fact appear to be made of cheese. You proudly send this report back up to KSC.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You fill your lab report with scribbled images of you planting a flag on the Mun (not to scale). You hope the folks back at KSC get the hint.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Wow, this place needs some acne medication.
