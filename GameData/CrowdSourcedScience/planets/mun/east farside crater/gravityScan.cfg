		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = The graviolis are having fun bouncing off the crater walls.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The gravity fluctuates slightly - but noticeably - as you pass over the crater below.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You try to convince the graviolis that this is indeed an entirely new crater and not at all the same as the last one.
		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = You wonder what sorts of questions this data will answer back at KSC. Other than "What is the gravity like above the Mun's East Farside Crater?"
		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = There might be a slight gravitational anomaly here.  Or you might just be seeing things and be in dire need of a snack.
