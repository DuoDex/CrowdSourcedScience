		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = Being on the farside, the weather tends to be more harsh here.
		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = Munar weather is pretty uninteresting.  But hey, now we know that for sure.

		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = Even here on the surface the experiment reveals no atmosphere.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The scientists back at KSC are disappointed that the results don't indicate the presence of an atmosphere on the surface below.
		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = You have to agree, this data is much better than throwing a dart at a dartboard.

		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = There is nothing materially important in the data. (Nerd joke alert!)

		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = Your feeble attempt to collect engineering data from so far away is successful, but leaves much more conclusive data to be collected.
