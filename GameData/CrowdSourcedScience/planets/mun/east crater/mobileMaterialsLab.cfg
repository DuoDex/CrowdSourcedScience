		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = Th materials promptly turn into a gooey mess from all the dust flying around at the surface.
		MunInSpaceLow = You gaze down at the crater below, absentmindedly stirring a flask of some unnamed substance.
		MunInSpaceLow = You hear repeated cries of "Are we there yet?" coming from the materials bay.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The samples ask to be woken up when you're on the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Why are we in a lab up here when we could be playing....erm, EVA-ing, in the crater below?
