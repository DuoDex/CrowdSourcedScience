		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The Goo sits there contentedly. You're not sure how an inanimate Goo can be content, but that really is the only way to describe it.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo demands a medal for being the first non-Kerbal in EVA around the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo looks like a bowl as it imitates the crater below.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo is really enjoying itself. You decide to let it romp around for a few more minutes while you have a snack. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to be quivering with excitement.
