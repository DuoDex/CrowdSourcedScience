		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.
		MunInSpaceLow = Ah the "East Crater". Yes, now that you're up close you can definitely tell which one it is. You totally didn't look at the map.
		MunInSpaceLow = ANOTHER crater?! Does this place have ANY flat land??
		MunInSpaceHigh = You sketch a map of the munar surface with the intention of taking it home to frame and hang on your wall. And, because you have time, you make a few autographed copies to sell on kBay.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You gaze down at the crater below as crumbs from the snack you are eating fall out of your mouth.
