		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = You feel a peculiar quake. When you look behind you, there is a fresh meteor impacted where you were just walking.
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You stare at the Mun amazed at how fast you are moving over the surface; maybe going out of the capsule was a bad decision.
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = It's hard to tell from outside the cockpit, but you think that you might be really low. You're not... in the crater, are you?
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You Stare at the Mun amazed at how fast you are moving over the surface; maybe going out of the capsule was a bad decision.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You're trying to decide how to describe this moment to the folks back home. You probably shouldn't mention the part where you peed inside your suit.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You can see the ridge of the crater below much more clearly through just the visor of your spacesuit.  Why did we bring a spaceship anyway?
