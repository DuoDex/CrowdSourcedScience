		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The experiment shows the weather is: dusty
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = After analyzing the data the meteorologists back at KSC declare the weather to be 'spacey with attributes of vacuuminess'. Much like the meteorologists themselves.
		MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = The weather here is just like at every other Munar crater.  When are we breaking out the snacks?

		MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = The data reveals that you are flying over the East Crater.  Who'd have known?

		MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = The experiment is highly uninformative. But hey, at least it was cheap!

		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = The engineering analysis of the East Crater reveals that it is nearly identical to the Western Crater.
		MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = The experiment doesn't return much useful data from this altitude.
