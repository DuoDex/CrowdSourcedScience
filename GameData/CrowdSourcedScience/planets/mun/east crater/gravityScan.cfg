		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The ship slides a few inches down into the crater as the graviolis swarm around you.
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Huh, even this close the Eastern Crater registers the exact same gravity as the Western Crater.  Good thing we brought a good map!
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Perhaps one day this data will be used to model tidal patterns back on Kerbin. Or something like that.
		MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = You let the graviolis go to work while you daydream about one day landing in the East Crater below. Or any other spot on the Mun really.
		MunInSpaceHighEastCrater = Reading: nominal.  It's a crater on the mun, what did you expect?
