		MunInSpaceLow = The temperature here is wholly uninteresting compared to the box of snacks in your hand.
		MunInSpaceLow = You read the thermal data and sadly put away your flip-flops.
		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = The temperature fluctuates wildly with the rotation of the moon, as the crater moves from day to night.
