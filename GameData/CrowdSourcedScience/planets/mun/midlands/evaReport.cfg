		MunSrfLandedMidlands = As you step off your lander, saying the usual dramatic speech, Mission Control calls up, tells you to cut the chatter and to take the all-important surface sample.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = You look up and hope that the rocket scientists back on Kerbin did their math correctly.
		MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Despite being relatively flat, the Midlands is still littered with debris from impact ejecta, making choosing a landing site a non-trivial matter.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Mission Control insists on guiding you step-by-step through this spacewalk. As a small act of rebellion, you do everything upside-down. They'll never know! Even you can't tell if you're really upside-down or not.
