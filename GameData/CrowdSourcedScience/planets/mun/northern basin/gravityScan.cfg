		MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The graviolis are strangely non-polar here.	
		MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The scanner is reading a large positive gravitational anomaly while over the Northern Basin.
		MunInSpaceHighNorthernBasin = A scientist back at KSC is guiding you through this gravity scan. He seems awfully excited about something called 'mascons'.
