		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = As you complete your lab reports you look forward to EVA-ing and running down the slope of the crater to see how fast you can get going.		
		MunInSpaceLow = The materials lab is ready for action! You, however, need a snack first to get you going.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It's getting very difficult to keep track of your experiments as they float around in the low gravity. Maybe you shouldn't have tried to them all at once.
