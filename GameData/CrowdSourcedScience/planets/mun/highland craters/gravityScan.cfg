		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The graviolis seem to have a higher velocity towards Scotland here since you're not in the Lowland Craters.
		MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = Wow these gravioli particles sure get excited when you activate the scanner.
		MunInSpaceHighHighlandCraters = You transmit the data back to KSC. Perhaps they can send you back something useful after they've processed the information.
