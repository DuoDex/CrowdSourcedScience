		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The Goo rolls around and around the rim of the crater, slowly moving toward the lowest part in the center.		
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo challenges you to a race to the munar surface! You laugh and lock it back inside its canister. Little do you know, a small piece of it has snuck into your suit...
		MunInSpaceHigh = You try to divide the goo into several parts. It easily flows around your clumsy fingers and forms back into its original shape.
