		IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Gravity is very slightly lower here, but almost imperceptably so and only on the instrumentation.
		IkeSrfLandedLowlands = Very little influence from the surrounding mountains is detected. Perhaps they all balance each other out?
		IkeInSpaceLowLowlands = Looks pretty featureless. No significant gravitational anomalies detected.
		IkeInSpaceHighLowlands = Any signatures from the Lowlands merge into the noise from the surrounding ridges and plateaus.
