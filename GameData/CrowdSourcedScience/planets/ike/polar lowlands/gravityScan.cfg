		IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Gravity scans hint at crustal deformation akin to that of a large impact crater.
		IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = It's peaceful on the gravity front up here, with Midlands on all sides and few large nearby mountains.
		IkeInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Gravity dips slightly as you pass over the depression, but the change is marginal.
		IkeInSpaceHighPolarLowlands = The sensor is registering the influence of the nearby Eastern Mountain Ridge on top of the other signals, but it's tenuous.
