		//IkeSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//IkeInSpaceLow = Your science report text here.
		//IkeInSpaceHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//IkeSrfLanded = The Science Rock looks like it's happy to be here. You make a note that it is a Science Rock and not a Pet Rock.
		//IkeSrfLanded = The samples resonate with a patriotic frequency. You know, middle E... the note the theme song starts on? You start to hum to yourself.
		IkeInSpaceLow = The samples cluster on the Ike-facing side. They must like Ike too.
		IkeInSpaceLow = You open and shut the doors to make the materials do something. All you succeed in doing is knocking some out.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Note to installing technicians: this is a science experiment, not a fancy groceries holder. Please leave your karrots somewhere else.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = One of the samples has drifted out of its container. You grab it with the remote arm to put it back in, and it crumbles to dust. Oh well.
