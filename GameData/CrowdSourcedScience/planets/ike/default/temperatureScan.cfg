		IkeInSpaceLow = Temperature readings are nominal for this distance from Kerbol - that is, to say, cold.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike's low albedo means it radiates a lot of heat at night.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = You tell yourself that this definitely isn't cold. You'll have to face even colder bodies later.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Picking up some heat radiating off Duna. Fancy that, Duna warming something up!
