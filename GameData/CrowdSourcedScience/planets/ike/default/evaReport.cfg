		//IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
		//IkeInSpaceLow = You get a strange sense of deja-vu.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life could... "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike is the iris to Duna's red eye. Huh. Never thought of that one before.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Magnificent desolation indeed. Even Ike's greyscale surface looks nicer from up here.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = It's hard to tell if Ike is moving across the face of Duna, or if it's just your orbit. Probably the latter.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike is no lump of rock. Ike is pretty. You like Ike.
		//LAST_ENTRY
