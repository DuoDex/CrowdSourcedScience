		IkeInSpaceLow = You take the lack of weather readings as an opportunity to relax a bit
		IkeInSpaceLow = The bleeping seems insistent you look at it. Eh, just a blip. Hopefully.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Every so often, there might be the faintest hints of Ike's exosphere.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Still a vacuum. Nothing here.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Why are we doing this again?
		IkeInSpaceHigh = You like Ike, but the meteorology equipment says otherwise. Eh? There's no atmosphere? You don't like Ike as much now.

		IkeInSpaceLow = Not even the faintest wisps of a magnetosphere.
		IkeInSpaceLow = The sensor beeps as it encounters the occasional charged particle.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike's exosphere is rarefied far beyond anything Kerbin has, and is much too thin for known aeronomical processes.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Any traces of an exosphere are far below this altitude.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = You instead repurpose the sensor to scan for cosmic radiation levels at Duna's distance.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike's lack of a magnetosphere allows the detection of the faintest traces of one of Duna's relic fields.

		IkeInSpaceLow = The cardboard box doesn't allow for samples to come loose, thankfully.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Why being in Ike space would affect materials any more than being anywhere else is beyond you, but you test them dutifully.
		IkeInSpaceLow = There's a very small amount of dust in orbit, gently battering the materials with micrometeoroids.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = It's just like in interplanetary space, with analyses on radiation blocking capabilities ongoing.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Mission Control asks you to make your surface samples into plates and put them outside if you've already been down to the surface.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Some of the materials fared better than others on their journey here. Ike doesn't affect them.

		IkeInSpaceLow = The engineers are itching to test their components in Ike's silicaceous dust.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Someone slipped some Goo into the box, and it's currently playing chess against the computer parts.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike must like the components, since all of them are currently working.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = The monitoring computer flips a bit and crashes. Seems solar radiation is still a threat to electronics this far out.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Just looking at Ike makes the filter seem clogged. You doublecheck it to make sure it's not.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = The solar temperature differential isn't as severe here, causing less thermal stress on the components.
