		IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The gravimeter clicks as it analyses the effects of the electrostatic nature of the dust on gravioli particles.
		IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = Mission Control tells you to stop bashing the sensor to make it run faster.
		IkeInSpaceLowSouthPole = Many craters are invisible in the long shadows, so the gravimetry readout helps locate them.
		IkeInSpaceHighSouthPole = Large amounts of piled regolith are visible in the data, even from this great height.
