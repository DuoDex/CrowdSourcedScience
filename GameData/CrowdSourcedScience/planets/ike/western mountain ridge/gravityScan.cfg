		IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = You'd say you can feel the higher gravity here, but that would be silly. The gravimeter does, though.
		IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The roots of the massive mountains don't have a distinct signature, suggesting Ike is solid for a long way down.
		IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = Now THAT is a gravity anomaly and a half. You start to worry about your orbital altitude.
		IkeInSpaceLowWesternMountainRidge = The huge mountain range below leaves a very clear signature on the chart.
		IkeInSpaceHighWesternMountainRidge = The beeping of the device startles you, and the reading startles you even more.
		IkeInSpaceHighWesternMountainRidge = The gravimeter notices the mountains before you do. And some mountains they are!
