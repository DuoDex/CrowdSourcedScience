		IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The gravitational anomaly generated by the mountain chain is clearly visible on the scanner.
		IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The centre of gravity here is noticeably different from Ike's geometric centre.
		IkeInSpaceLowEasternMountainRidge = The needle jumps rapidly as you pass over he hulking mountains below, before returning to normal.
		IkeInSpaceHighEasternMountainRidge = The gravitational influence of the ridge below is fuzzy but visible even this high up.
