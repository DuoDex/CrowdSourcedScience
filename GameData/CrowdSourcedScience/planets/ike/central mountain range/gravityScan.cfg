		IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The gravity strength varies slightly with time, suggesting Ike is is an elliptical orbit.
		IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = Duna's gravitational influence is strong here. With these tidal forces, it's little wonder Ike and Duna are mutually locked.
		IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = That's a big bump, and that can only mean one thing - a big mountain (or many mountains)!
		IkeInSpaceHighCentralMountainRange = Pointing the detector towards the north and south gives you high readings, towards the east or west they drop. Hrm.
