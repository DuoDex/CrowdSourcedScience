		IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = It seems like a hike would be nice. What might you see from the other side of this moon? Pack plenty of air!
		IkeSrfLandedCentralCountainRange = Duna hangs in the sky overhead. You think back to the Mun landings, then realise looking at it has made you lose your balance.
		IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
		IkeInSpaceLowCentralMountainRange = That red ball is always on the edge of your vision, reminding you that you'd much rather be down there than up here.
