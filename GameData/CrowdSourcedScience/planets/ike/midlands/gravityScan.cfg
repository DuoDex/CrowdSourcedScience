		IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Nothing out of the ordinary here. Even Duna's influence is dulled.
		IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The lines on the graph draw a smiley face. Even Ike likes you back.
		IkeInSpaceLowMidlands = Where the Midlands begin and end is hard to pick out from the quiescence of the Lowlands and strength of the mountain chains.
		IkeInSpaceHighMidlands = Why does every Midlands biome have to have gravity this constant and boring?
