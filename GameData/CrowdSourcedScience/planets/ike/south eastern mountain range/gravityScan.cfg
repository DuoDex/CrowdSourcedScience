		IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The dust is attracted to electric charge, and currently it's all over the gravimeter.
		IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = The line waves lazily across the display. Everything seems to run slower on Ike, as though the low gravity is slowing time.
		IkeInSpaceLowSouthEasternMountainRange = The mountains have a clear gravimetric signature, distinct from all the other features around them.
		IkeInSpaceHighSouthEasternMountainRange = According to the "Gravimetric Signature Identification Guide Volume XII", that reading means "mountain".
