		DresSrfLanded = You were right... it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.
		DresInSpaceLow = It's very gray and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better gray-resistant landing legs.

		DresInSpaceHigh = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
		DresInSpaceHigh = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
