		GillySrfLanded = You have to tap the sensor a few times before it realizes that gravity is, in fact, present.
		GillySrfLanded = The instrument hardly recognizes the asteroid below.
		GillySrfLanded = The gravioli detector reports that there is NO gravity on this dwarf asteroid... wait, there's like 0.01 gravity units here.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner decides that the ship has more gravity than Gilly.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = The gravity is ridiculous. Playing ker-ball on Gilly might end up putting the ball in orbit.
