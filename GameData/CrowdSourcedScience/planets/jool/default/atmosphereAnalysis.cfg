		JoolFlyingLow = It's so incredibly dense.
		JoolFlyingLow = Engineers scramble to adjust calculations to account for the new, very large crack in the instrument casing.
		JoolFlyingLow = The drag and pressure almost shuts down the science machinery. The main report reads: "Pressure Warning: Gain altitude immediately!"
		JoolFlyingLow = The computer running the atmosphere analysis tool crashed. That's probably not good. Upon return, you plan to have a word with the engineers who designed this computer.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere here is made of little but hydrogen and helium.
		JoolFlyingLow = "Do you smell that? That smelly smell... it smells... smelly..."
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be very thick here.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere is getting much denser now. However, it appears to be unusually transparent.
		JoolFlyingLow = Don't be silly.
		JoolFlyingLow = The chlorine content is extremely high here, explaining how the planet got its distinctive green color.
		JoolFlyingLow = The instrument housing is starting to buckle under the immense pressure.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere seems to consist mostly of hydrogen and chlorine.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The sensors detect high concentrations of chlorine and helium. You are fascinated, but suspect your findings will cause some headaches for planetary scientists back on Kerbin.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis reveals unexpectedly high concentrations of molecular chlorine. You try not to think about what this corrosive gas might be doing to the spacecraft.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Microscopic diamonds, tossed up from liquid carbon far below, are detected in the scanner.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The Joolian clouds contain the expected hydrogen and helium, with substantial amounts of chlorine present.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium-3 with traces of chlorine. Don't breathe it!
