		JoolFlyingLow = You notice the barometer has a crack in it shaped like a doughnut. There's also a reading about the pressure, but you've stopped caring.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer's hand switched from "You sure we're in an atmosphere and not underwater?" to "Look, I wasn't built to record pressures in kbar". It suddenly dawns on you that you might have aerobraked a bit too deep.
		JoolFlyingLow = The sensor starts breaking under pressure.
		JoolFlyingLow = The immense pressure causes the sensor to implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = Pressure increases quite rapidly, then stabilizes on "-65535". It occurs to you that the barometer may be broken.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer reads lower than expected. Perhaps you are in the eye of a storm?
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer lets out some steam and fails to give a proper reading of the immensely thick atmosphere.
		JoolFlyingLow = The scanner only has time to say "I hate you!" before the voice module implodes.
		JoolFlyingLow = The gas chamber just cracked. Any deeper and this whole craft might implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = Jool seems to be under a lot of pressure right now.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Cracks start to appear as you enter deeper into the atmosphere.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The pressures start rising in comparison to the surrounding area. You take this as a good sign - Joolian storms are nothing to sneeze at.
		JoolFlyingHigh = A massive blast of wind shakes the spacecraft. Of course, you didn't exactly need a barometer to tell you this.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is very dense. The glass components appear to be weakening. Let's blame the engineers if anything breaks!
