		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if the temperature reading is accurate or if the gravity is so strong the mercury can't rise properly...
		EveSrfSplashed = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.
		EveSrfSplashed = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.
		EveSrfSplashed = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.
		EveInSpaceLow = You detect a definite heat signature from the planet below.
