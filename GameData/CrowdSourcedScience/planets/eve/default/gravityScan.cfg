		EveSrfLanded = The sensor's overload warning is on. It appears Eve's gravity is almost too much.
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.
		EveInSpaceLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.
		EveInSpaceHigh = The sensor spikes every time you orbit over an ocean.
