		EveSrfLanded = The toss of a pebble suggests that the atmosphere is REALLY, REALLY thick.
		EveSrfSplashed = You had a dream like this once. Unlike the dream, however, this isn't grape soda, and robot dolphins are not swimming in it.
		EveFlyingLow = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.
		EveFlyingHigh = "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!"
		EveInSpaceLow = "I left the stove on!"
		EveInSpaceHigh = From this position you can clearly make out lakes and oceans of some kind on the surface below.
