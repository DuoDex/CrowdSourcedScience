		EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = The materials that have not melted are one by one starting to catch fire. This probably has implications for space suit design.
		EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.
		EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSea = The materials melt and/or explode. We may want ot get out of here.
