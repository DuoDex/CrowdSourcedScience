		LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Looking at the map of Laythe to figure out which of the islands is the closest, you know it'll be a long swim for any chance of rescue.
		LaytheFlyingLow = Are you sure we aren't on Kerbin?
		LaytheFlyingHigh = Readings for alpha and beta radiation are low here, but there are still elevated readings for X-Rays and gamma radiation.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Your radiation instruments are showing some strange results. Perhaps Laythe has a magnetic field that is interacting with Jool's.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = The radiation here must be intense. You are glad the cockpit of your spacecraft is heavily shielded.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at Laythe, you begin to wonder whether Kerbin is the only planet harboring life.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = As the crew look down upon Laythe, they are reminded of home and the huge distance they have traveled.
