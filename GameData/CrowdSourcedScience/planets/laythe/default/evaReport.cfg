		LaytheSrfLanded = You feel a slight tremor. Perhaps you should have landed on that OTHER island.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet's protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe Kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it's because of lower oxygen content.
		LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
+		LaytheSrfLanded = You wonder for a moment whether it would be safe or not to open the seal on your helmet. After a moment of consideration, you decide to play it safe and leave the helmet on.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could swim to the nearest island.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You realize that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You attempt to drink some water. Then you remember the co-worker who died after ordering some "H2O too".
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You tread water. Perhaps you should have chosen a drier landing spot.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Swimming is really hard in these suits you know.
		LaytheFlyingLow = Now I really wish I had brought that parachute.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = As you repair one of the heat shielding tiles that fell off, you are reminded of your first return through Kerbin's' atmosphere.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = As you gaze down upon the flowing waters of Laythe, you discover that you need a toilet.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = You almost feel like you are floating above Kerbin.
