		LaytheSrfLanded = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
		LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
