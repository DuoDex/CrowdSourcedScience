		LaytheSrfLanded = Some of the samples spill and soak into the soil. You silently pray that the samples are sterile.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Certain samples react explosively with Laythe's oceans. Or perhaps the sensor is reacting explosively? It's hard to tell.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The materials suddenly gather by the window, looking at the surface below.
