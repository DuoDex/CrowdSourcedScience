		LaytheSrfLanded = It's quite cold here. You would definitely need some warm clothes if you were ever to walk around without your spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The temperatures here are below water's freezing point. Clearly, the water here has odd characteristics.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The temperature fluctuates more than expected.
