		LaytheSrfLanded = The seismic graph is going crazy. The Joolian system seems to be subjecting Laythe to an unholy chiropractic session.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You notice the ground starting to shake. You might want to leave soon.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's surface stretches and flexes under the strain of tidal forces from Jool.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The sensor is detecting heavy seismic activity deep below the surface. Perhaps Laythe has previously undetected volcanic activity. Only time will tell.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You've set the craft right on top of a fault line! You find this both fascinating and absolutely terrifying.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe shows some very important seismic activity. You're not sure the craft can survive a tsunami, but at least it keeps the moon temperate.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land.
