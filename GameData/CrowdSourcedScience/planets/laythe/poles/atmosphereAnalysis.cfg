		LaytheSrfLandedPoles = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.
		LaytheFlyingLowPoles = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
		LaytheFlyingHighPoles = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photo-dissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
