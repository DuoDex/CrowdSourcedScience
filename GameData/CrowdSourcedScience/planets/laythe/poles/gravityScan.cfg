		LaytheSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
		LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Shaking the scanner does not seem to budge it. Instead you get out a golf ball and club. Gravity must be weaker than on Kerbin because you just hit it far enough for a hole in one!
		LaytheInSpaceLowPoles = Your scanner shows that the gravitational draw of this moon does not change wherever you go. The water makes the planet smoother than a baby Kerbal's bottom.
