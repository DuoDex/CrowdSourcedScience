		LaytheSrfLandedPoles = The Goo seems excited. Perhaps it wants to swim in the ocean?
		LaytheFlyingLow = You note that the mystery goo Containment Unit is wobbling a little. Is that the Goo? Or is it just the screws coming loose?
		LaytheFlyingHigh = There does not seem to be much activity coming from the Containment Unit. Only close examination reveals a slight pulsing.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems right at home in space.
