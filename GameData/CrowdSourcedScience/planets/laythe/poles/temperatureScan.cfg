		LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Kerbol looks smaller than you remember, it is not sending much heat to the surface. Why does the water stay liquid?
		LaytheFlyingLowPoles = Your temperature scan shows that it is too cold to pop a window open.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The temperature here looks much the same as anywhere else in space, a few degrees above absolute zero.
