		EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.
		EelooInSpaceLow = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.
