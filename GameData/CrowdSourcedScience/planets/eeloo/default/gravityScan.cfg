		EelooSrfLanded = This planetoid has a small but significant gravitational force, perfect for extreme snowball fights.
		EelooInSpaceLow = The gravity of Eeloo is relatively small, which in turn gives it a small SoI. You are happy that the guys back on Kerbin are actually skilled enough to hit an object of this size from so far away.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Before you left Kerbin, the program director told you of the great gravity of your mission. It is clear to you now that he exaggerated.
