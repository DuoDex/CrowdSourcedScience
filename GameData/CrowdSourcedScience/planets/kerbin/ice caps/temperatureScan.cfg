		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = If this is normal, you hate to think of how cold it can get.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The temperature is higher than 30 years ago. You ponder why.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Welp. That explains all the ice.
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid, so why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = As you read off the temperature to Mission Control, you are envious of how warm they all sound over the radio.
