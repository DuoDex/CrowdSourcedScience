		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The Goo starts to freeze. It doesn't seem to like it.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The Goo tentatively slides itself across the ice. It doesn't know how to stop so you have to go and pick it up.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Bits of ice and snow become lodged in the Goo as you open the container. The Goo doesn't seem too happy about that.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo's temperature suddenly drops several dozen degrees below ambient, as if proving it could do better.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo shivers as you open the container. You could swear you hear it say "Hey! Shut the door!"
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo decides that the best way to stay warm is by being inside your spacesuit. You aren't too happy about this arrangement. 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo is holding on to the inside of the container, and you're unable to open it.  You record the Goo as being "uncooperative".
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to pulse with dull flashes of colour. Is it mimicking an aurora?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems happy, but mildly reticent of your current location.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems fine with being high over Kerbin's Ice Caps.
