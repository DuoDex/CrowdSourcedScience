		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = You have determined that water temperature does not affect buoyancy.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = The sight of Kerbin from high over the Ice Caps is enough to make you pause your experiments and take some time to enjoy the view.
