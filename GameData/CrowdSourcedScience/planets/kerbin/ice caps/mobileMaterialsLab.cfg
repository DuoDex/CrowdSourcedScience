		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Your samples are huddling together for warmth.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The samples are shivering too hard for you to get any useful science out of them.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The materials in the lab are viscous and difficult to work with. After struggling for a while you write up the data that you can, ready for the folks back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You make note to bring a climate-controlled materials lab next time. The one you currently have appears to be frozen solid.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The light reflects off the surface of the planet below as you stare out the window. Oh yeah....science. You finish writing up your report for the kerbals back at KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You write something suitably scientific and go back to watching the auroras swirl about the Ice Caps.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab has a certain serenity flying so high above the planet. There is no place you'd rather be right now.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The sight of Kerbin from high over the Ice Caps is enough to make you pause your experiments and take some time to enjoy the view.
