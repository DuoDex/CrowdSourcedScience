		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You take a sample of the ice. Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You are amazed at how much microscopic life is contained within the piece of frozen water currently in your hands.
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = The water might be freezing, but it's still teeming with microscopic life.
