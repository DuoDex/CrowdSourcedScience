		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Significant quantities of X-rays produced by aurorae are detected, even on the surface.
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = Aeronomy equipment is particular sensitive, and thus does not respond well to a dunking in icy water.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The nature of the polar ice would lend itself very well to a neutrino observatory that can do a lot more than this fancy cardboard box.
