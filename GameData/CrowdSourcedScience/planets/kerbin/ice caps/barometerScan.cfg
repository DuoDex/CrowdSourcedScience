		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The dial is stuck. You're too busy freezing to care.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Your blood pressure rises as you see just how close you are flying to the icy terrain below. The barometric pressure, in contrast, remains steady.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Atmospheric pressure is fairly high in the polar regions. Perhaps the scientists back at KSC can explain why.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = High over the Ice Caps you take a barometric reading.  Doesn't matter, as the instrument seems to read the same thing everywhere.  Why did we bring this stupid instrument anyway?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The air is too thin for the barometer to function. Much like how the air is too cold for a kerbal to function.
