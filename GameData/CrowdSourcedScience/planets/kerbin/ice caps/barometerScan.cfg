		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Atmospheric pressure is fairly high in the polar regions. Perhaps the scientists back at KSC can explain why.
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = The dial is stuck. You're too busy freezing to care.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = High over the Ice Caps you take a barometric reading. Doesn't matter, as the instrument seems to read the same thing everywhere. Why did we bring this stupid instrument anyway?
		//LAST_ENTRY
