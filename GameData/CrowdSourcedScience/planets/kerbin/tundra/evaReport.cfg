		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around sort of hoping you could find a moose to ride on.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around the stunted trees noting that you are FINALLY taller than something.
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = The cold from the water starts to seep into your suit. It's not pleasant.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Dude, seriously. You know what happens when we try to EVA here. It never ends well.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Those snowdrifts look soft enough to catch you safely. You still don't want to try though.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Your spacesuit keeps you warm even as the brutal winds of the Tundra buffet you outside your craft.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Even with only a thin spacesuit and small amount of space separating you from the landscape below the plant life still looks tiny and stunted.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You marvel at how many plants can look so small as you consider letting go of the ship to float freely through space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Oh look it's the Tundra! It looks cold and inhospitable even from up here.
