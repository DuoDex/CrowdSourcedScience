		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around sort of hoping you could find a moose to ride on.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wander around the stunted trees noting that you are FINALLY taller than something.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Dude, seriously.  You know what happens when we try to EVA here.  It never ends well.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Those snowdrifts look soft enough to catch you safely. You still don't want to try though.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Your spacesuit keeps you warm even as the brutal winds of the Tundra buffet you outside your craft.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Even with only a thin spacesuit separating you from the landscape below the plant life still looks tiny and stunted.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You marvel at how many plants can look so small as you consider letting go of the ship to float freely through space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Oh look it's the Tundra! It looks cold and inhospitable even from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wave in the general direction of Kerbin. Hi Tundra! Bye Tundra!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You do a somersault and a back-flip from the hatch onto the side of the ship.  How do you like THAT KSC?
