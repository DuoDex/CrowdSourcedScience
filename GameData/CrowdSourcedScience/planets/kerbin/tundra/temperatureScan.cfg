		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The thermometer reading makes you want to go home and snuggle under a blanket.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = It's cold enough to keep things permanently frozen here.
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = It's pretty cold, but not quite cold enough to freeze the water.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = It's normally cold at the surface, and now you're flying the wind chill just makes it even colder.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The coldness must explain why the surface below is frozen and the plants are stunted. You feel like a genius.
