		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The samples inside your lab have devolved into a hunter-gatherer state as a response to the harsh conditions of the Tundra.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The lab seems small and cramped here. You quickly finish your report and get some fresh air.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = As you open the materials bay, snow rapidly accumulates inside, making it difficult to perform your experiments.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The materials seem to have shrunk in their containers, which makes completing your research difficult. Hey, we're getting hazard pay for this, right?
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = Materials float just as well in cold water as warm water. You know this because the bay is full of it.
