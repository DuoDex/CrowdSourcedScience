		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The samples inside your lab have devolved into a hunter-gatherer state as a response to the harsh conditions of the Tundra.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The lab seems small and cramped here. You quickly finish your report and get some fresh air.
		KerbinFlyingLow = As you open the materials bay, snow rapidly accumulates inside, making it difficult to perform your experiments. 
		KerbinFlyingLow = The materials seem to have shrunk in their containers, which makes completing your research difficult.  Hey, we're getting hazard pay for this, right?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = In your lab report, you include a note asking Mission Control to send you someplace warmer next time.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = With all the experiments well underway you grab a box of snacks, wishing it was bigger than it is.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Low-gravity experiments in space over Kerbin's Tundra. Just another day for a kerbonaut.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab has a certain 'vacuuminess' to it here. You note that in the report to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You finally finish writing a disgustingly long lab report. Oh well, at least your office has a good view.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The air in the lab seems stale and cramped even though you are far above the planet. You wonder why.
