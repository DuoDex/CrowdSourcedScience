		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = As you shiver even inside a heated capsule, you find it hard to believe that your ancestors once lived in such conditions.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You peer out the spacecraft window at the stunted plant growth, and wonder if this is where the first Kerbal came from.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Maybe you'll see a bear! Or a wolf! Or an Eskimo!
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = That water sure looks chilly. You're glad you're in here and not in it.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You look at the ground below you and see the frosted hills. It reminds you of the cake you had for breakfast.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You look down and see a glimmer. There's gold in these hills!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Moose!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Please don't land here, please don't land here, please don't land here...
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Nothing down there looks like it's enjoying itself.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = The stunted trees below make it seem like you are further away than you already are. Are we in space yet? And when do we break out the snacks?
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = From this height, you can clearly see where hard ice meets harsh rock meets cold snow. Not a very nice place to live.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = From this distance the already tiny plants growing on the tundra below are so small you can barely see them.
