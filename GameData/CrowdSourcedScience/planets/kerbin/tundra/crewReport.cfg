		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = As you shiver even inside a heated capsule, you find it hard to believe that your ancestors once lived in such conditions.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You peer out the spacecraft window at the stunted plant growth, and wonder if this is where the first Kerbal came from.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Maybe you'll see a bear! Or a wolf! Or an Eskimo!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You look at the ground below you and see the frosted hills. It reminds you of the cake you had for breakfast.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You look down and see a glimmer. There's gold in these hills!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Moose!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Please don't land here, please don't land here, please don't land here...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Nothing down there looks like it's enjoying itself.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The stunted trees below make it seem like you are further away than you already are.  Are we in space yet? And when do we break out the snacks?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = From this height, you can clearly see where hard ice meets harsh rock meets cold snow. Not a very nice place to live.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = From this distance the already tiny plants growing on the tundra below are so small you can barely see them.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You count the snowstorms passing over the Tundra below and are suddenly glad you don't have to be down there.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is that Tundra below? You are so far from the planet that you can only make a wild guess.  So you do, and report it as solid fact back to KSC.
