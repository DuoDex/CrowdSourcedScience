		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = You wonder how much bigger the bears and wolves would be without this gravity. Thanks gravity!
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The gravity here seems to be stunted, just like everything else in this bleak landscape.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You and the graviolis huddle together for warmth.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = The graviolis seem sluggish and unresponsive.  You wonder if they need a snack as much as you do.
		KerbinInSpaceHighTundra = You wonder why the gravity field seems weaker here, and then remember that you are flying over the Tundra.  Everything is smaller in the Tundra.
		KerbinInSpaceHighTundra = You let the gravity scanner do its thing while you admire the view you have over Kerbin's Tundra.
