		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Meteorological observations confirm that the climate of this place is cold and dry.
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = Strong winds blow across the open water. Strong, cold winds.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Wind speeds are surprisingly low. Either you're flying with the wind, or it's gone eerily calm.

		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = A moose starts chewing the cardboard. You don't fancy going out to shoo it away.
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = Amazingly, the freezing and waterlogged aeronomy equipment still functions perfectly. The water must be magic.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Aurorae are less common here than at the extreme poles, but their particle signature is unmistakeable.

		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The low temperatures and humidities seem to be excellent for preserving various perishable materials.
		KerbinSrfSplashedTunda = No, you can't make rockets out of salt just because the water is cold.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The cold wind has the same effect as a warm wind. That is to say, everything flies out.
