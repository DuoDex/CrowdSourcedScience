		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The barometer reads very low here. You aren't surprised, as the mountaintop nearly pierces the clouds.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You stand on your tiptoes and try to insert the barometer into a passing cloud. So close...
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The air pressure is dropping precipitously. Much like that goat that just fell off the mountain.
