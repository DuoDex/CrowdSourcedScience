		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The barometer reads very high here.  You aren't surprised as the mountaintop nearly pierces the clouds.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You stand on your tiptoes and try to insert the barometer into a passing cloud. So close...
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer shakes and shimmies so much in the atmosphere that you are unable to get an accurate reading.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The air pressure is dropping precipitously. Much like that goat that just fell off the mountain.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = In the thin, wispy layers of the upper atmosphere a barometer reading is not particularly useful.  You take the reading anyway and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer data you transmit back to KSC barely qualifies as a proper reading.
