		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The Goo looks happy to be back on solid ground.  Actually, so do you.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The Goo doesn't seem nearly as bothered as it should be by the fact that it's hanging off the side of a mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be eyeing the mountains with both fear and longing.  You both hope that the SAS keeps working.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems slightly intimidated by the sheer size of the surrounding mountains.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo seems to be enjoying the refreshing breeze now that you opened the container.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what would happen if you made an entire mountain out of Goo. 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be trying to imitate the shape of a mountain.  You wonder why.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You and the Goo sit in companionable silence as you gaze out over Kerbin's mountaintops. Then you shove it back inside its canister before it makes your capsule slimy.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you stare blankly at the Goo you wonder if there is anti-Goo somewhere, spinning in the opposite direction.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you open the Goo canister high over Kerbin's mountain ranges, you worry that it might not want to go back in this time.
