		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The temperature reports a chilly -15 degrees. You are glad to be inside your nice warm spaceship. With snacks!
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = It's cold sure, but the windchill is even worse! You hope it doesn't blow you off the mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = It's cold, OK. Just look where you're going, and PLEASE don't turn off the SAS again.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You're too busy dodging sudden mountains to pay attention to your latest temperature scan.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Glancing back and forth between the mountains beneath you and the thermometer display, you realize that you are stuck between a rock and a cold place.
