		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The temperature reports a chilly -15 degrees. You are glad to be inside your nice warm spaceship.  With snacks!
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = It's cold sure, but the windchill is even worse! You hope it doesn't blow you off the mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = It's cold, OK.  Just look where you're going, and PLEASE don't turn off the SAS again.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You're too busy dodging sudden mountains to pay attention to your latest temperature scan.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It is chilly up here in the thin wisps of the upper atmosphere.  You report this to KSC, and they laugh back something about being happy they aren't in your shoes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Glancing back and forth between the mountains beneath you and the thermometer display, you realize that you are stuck between a rock and a cold place.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Roses are red, violets are blue (apparently), the mountains are pretty, and space is cold." Mission Control doesn't seem to appreciate your poetry.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Space is cold everywhere.  Unless you are facing the sun or a supernova.  Hey! We should go check out one of THOSE!!
