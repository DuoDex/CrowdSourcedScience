		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = On solid ground you are able to detect the faint anomalies in the gravitational field caused by the mountain you are standing on.  The guys back at KSC will be excited!
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You can tell that the gravity is still on by the fact that you're standing on a mountain instead of floating in outer space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The gravitational field is rather strong in these mountain ranges.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The mountains below give off a suitably impressive gravitational signature.
		KerbinInSpaceHighMountains = The massive mountain range below registers on your gravitational scanner as you fly by.  Just another day in the life of an astronaut.
		KerbinInSpaceHighMountains = The graviolis are excited about the prospect of passing over the mountains of Kerbin.
