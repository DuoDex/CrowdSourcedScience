		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You feel like the king of the world standing on this mountain.  Or at least the king of the mountain.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = As your craft settles precipitously near a sharp drop, you reflect on the need to attach cleats to all future landing gear.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You keep a sharp lookout for sudden mountains.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay, just hallucinating.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = As you hurtle past the mountainside at a reckless speed, you almost hit a very surprised mountain goat.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The mountains rise up from the grasslands of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from up here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Even from up here, Kerbin's mountains remain an imposing sight.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You peer down at the mountains below, wondering if there is anyone down there looking up at you.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You tell Mission Control that some of those mountains seem perfectly suited for an observatory.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can barely make out the ridges of Kerbin's mountains from this altitude, but enjoy a few snacks with the view.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From this distance, Kerbin's mountain ranges blend into one big blob.
