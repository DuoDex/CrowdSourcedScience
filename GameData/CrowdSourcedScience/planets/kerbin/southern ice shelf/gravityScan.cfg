		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The gravimeter abruptly stops working. On closer inspection, the heat of the circuitry melted some salty ice, shorting the very expensive equipment.
		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = Gravitationally speaking, the southern ice sheet is as featureless as its surface.
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The gravitational signature moves only slightly as you pass over the southern ice cap. Looks like it's water all the way down.
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Graviolis cascade down towards the surface, closely following magnetic field lines.
		KerbinInSpaceHighSouthernIceShelf = You could swear the gravitational signature changed since you last looked. Did a bug lump of ice just melt?
		KerbinInSpaceHighSouthernIceShelf = Most of the reading is clouded out by noise from the adjoining continent.
