		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = You're so close to the pole you could swear the compass needle changes orientation with every step.
		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The ice here isn't snow, and what little loose stuff there is is no good for making snowballs.
		KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = The rushing air somehow makes it even colder. Can we get back in now?
		KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = Looking down at the flat ice you can't tell how fast you're moving, or even if you're moving at all. It's unnerving.
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The ice caps gleam brilliantly in the sun. They have a splendent beauty from space, but you know how bad they are on the ground.
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = The great ice platform below traces an outline through the sea that could easily be mistaken for a true continent.
