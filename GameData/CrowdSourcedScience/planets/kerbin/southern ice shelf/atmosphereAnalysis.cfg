		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = No hint of any complex organic molecules. Just air and ice crystals.
		KerbinSrfLandedSouthernIceShelf = The freezing polar wind whistles past the craft as the sensor scoops it up. You're glad you're not out there.
		KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = Water content of the air is low, despite the large amounts of frozen water not far below.
		KErbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = You wonder how cold it would need to be for you to hold a pot out the window and scoop the air up like a solid.
		KerbinFlyingHighSouthernIceShelf = Legends of wispy, shimmering clouds have been drifting around the polar kerbal communities for millennia. Turns out they are real, and made of ice crystals.
		KerbinFlyingHighSouthernIceShelf = The high-altitude polar vortex brings cold, dry, thin air from other parts of the poles, mixing their individual gas signatures.
