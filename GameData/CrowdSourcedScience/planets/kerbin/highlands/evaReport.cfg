		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You catch yourself as you nearly step into a 100 meter crevasse and slide down a massive glacier. No wonder they call this the Highlands.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The hills are steep and the weather is miserable. No wonder people from the Highlands are always so cranky.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You are afraid that your helmet will hit the peak of one of the mountains as you fly by.  Who thought an EVA was a good idea here, anyway.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You're pretty sure you can reach out and grab a surface sample from the top of one of these hills.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You hold on for dear life as you hurtle through the atmosphere above some of Kerbin's highest mountains.  Too much adrenaline.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Yep, those are the Highlands. Can I go back in now?
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Yup, that's a mountain down there.  What's of greater concern is the mountain of snacks that need to be eaten *nom, nom, nom*.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The Highlands are baby mountains. You wonder if you'll ever get to see them grow up.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the frosty peaks of the planet below, and contemplate the meaning of life.  And the integrity of your spacesuit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Highlands must be so jealous of you right now.
