		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You make adjustments to the barometer to get an accurate reading at such a high altitude. Hopefully they appreciate your work back at KSC.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Barometer data indicates higher-than-normal humidity and precipitation. You guess that's just what happens when you're closer to the sky. 
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The barometer indicates an incoming storm! You feel sorry for anyone living in the valleys of the Highlands.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Pressure readings are more or less in line with the rest of Kerbin. Much unlike the Highlands themselves.
