		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You make adjustments to the barometer to get an accurate reading at such a high altitude.  Hopefully they appreciate your work back at KSC.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Barometer data indicates higher-than-normal humidity and precipitation. You guess that's just what happens when you're closer to the sky. 
		KerbinFlyingLow = *singing* "Under pressure. Ba da dum, ba da da dum, Ba da da dum, ba da da dum. Under pressure".
		KerbinFlyingLow = Pressure readings are more or less in line with the rest of Kerbin. Much unlike the Highlands themselves.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer is covered in ice crystals at this altitude, and you are unable to get a good reading.  Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer indicates an incoming storm! You feel sorry for anyone living in the valleys of the Highlands.
