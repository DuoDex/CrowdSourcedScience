		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The thermometer tube seems to have exploded in the thin atmosphere here. We really shouldn't have bought the cheapest thermometer available.  Oh well, no temperature reading today.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = It's quite chilly out here! The thermometer agrees. 
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The snow and ice of the mountains has gotten stuck to the display of the thermometer.  As  you wipe it off and take a reading you are reminded of the snacks in your fridge back at home.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The brisk wind of the Highlands is making you feel colder than what the thermometer suggests.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature here is higher than you expected, what with all the ice and snow.  Maybe THAT's why they call it the Highlands.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = What is it about height that makes things colder? 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you look down over the majestic mountains below you take yet another temperature reading.  Stupid science.  At least the view is nice.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The fact that you are over the Highlands does not change the thermometer's opinion on the coldness of space one bit.
