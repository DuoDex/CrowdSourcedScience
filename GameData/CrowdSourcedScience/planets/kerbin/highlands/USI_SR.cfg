		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The higher altitude means the air is cool and dry. This would be a good spot for a monitoring station.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The temperature rises sharply above the level of the hilltops, suggesting a major temperature inversion is present.

		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You're not quite high enough to start seeing major changes in the atmosophere yet. Go to the Mountains for that.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = All readings are the same as when landed here, probably because of the high altitude to begin with.
