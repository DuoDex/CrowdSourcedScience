		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There's a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The thick mist of Kerbin's Highlands is of much interest to the scientists back at Mission Control.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Even at this low altitude the atmosphere seems thin here.  Thoughts of a space-sherpa come to mind.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The atmospheric sensor reports higher-than-average humidity. This is supported by the thick fog and the light sheen of wet grass.
		KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = Pfft, Highlands yeah right. Whoever named this place must have pretty low standards.
		KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = The atmosphere here seems squeezed between the high altitude of the mountains below, and the invisible barrier of space above. You are somewhere between a rock and no-place.
