		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The graviolis seem very weak here.  Maybe it has something to to with the high altitude.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The graviolis react differently as you pass over certain hills and valleys.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The instrument surveys the Highlands of Kerbin. The rolling hills seem to affect local gravity slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The gravity signature of the Highlands is only slightly distinguishable from the plains around it.
		KerbinInSpaceHighHighlands = Even at this distance, the gravity scan picks up the distinct signature of the massive mountains below.
		KerbinInSpaceHighHighlands = Gravity scans from high orbit are yielding some interesting tidbits about the Highlands. Speaking of tidbits, where did you put those snacks?
