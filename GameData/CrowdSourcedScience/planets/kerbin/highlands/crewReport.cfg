		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = KSC, we have landed. I think. The altimeter still shows way too high for us to be on the ground, but our velocity is zero. So there you have it. Maybe.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Landing in the Highlands woohoo! Break out the celebratory kilts and bagpipes!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = There can be only one report from the Highlands!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is it still the Highlands if you're over a quarter million meters above it?
		//LAST_ENTRY
