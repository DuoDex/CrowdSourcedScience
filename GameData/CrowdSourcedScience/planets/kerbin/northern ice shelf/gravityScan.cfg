		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Gravity is lower compared to the land of the ice caps. There must be a serious lack of rock beneath your feet.
		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = You hit upon the idea of using gravimetric analysis to map the bathymetry underneath the impenetrable pack ice.
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = You feel much more comfortable doing gravimetry from up here rather than down there, freezing your butt off.
		KerbinInSpaceHighNorthernIceShelf = The frozen-over Northern Ocean bears a distinctive gravitational signature together with the polar hills ringing it.
		KerbinInSpaceHighNorthernIceShelf = Frozen sea appears to have the same gravimetric characteristics as normal sea.
