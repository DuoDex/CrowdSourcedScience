		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Light from the ship and sky gleams off the shining white ground.
		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The ground is white. The sky is white. Even the notepad paper is white.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = Even from this vantage point you can't see anything over the horizon.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = The solid white, flat surface makes it difficult to judge altitude. Don't think about the prospect you could be dangerously low.
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = It looks flat, white and boring from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = You squint, and struggle to tell where the land ends and sea ice begins.
