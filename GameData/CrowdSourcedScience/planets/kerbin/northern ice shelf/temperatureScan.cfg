		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = It's cold enough to freeze even salty sea water completely solid.
		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = A rise in temperature would be very alarming, considering you are standing on something eminently meltable.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = The temperature is extremely low. It has to be, to maintain such a colossal mass of ice like that below.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = Wind chill from the strong winds that howl across the flats drops the temperature even lower.
