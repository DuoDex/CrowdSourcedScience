		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = The air is mostly cold and dry, with a hint of freezing sea breeze.
		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = An unexpected squall of polar air hits the craft, and fills the analyser with ice crystals.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = There are strong traces of windblown snow kicked up by the powerful winds that blow over the icy flats.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = At least in the absence of hills you don't have to pay attention to very much while the gadget does its thing.
		KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf = The ice has petered out by now, but there's still enough moisture in the air to glaze the sensor in ice.
		KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf = The gas mix high above the ice plains seems much the same as over the equator.
