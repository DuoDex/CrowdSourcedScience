		//KerbinSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//KerbinSrfLanded = Finally. Time to stretch your legs!
		//KerbinSrfLanded = I wish I had brought pants.
		//KerbinSrfLanded = It seems we are on our home planet.
		//KerbinSrfLanded = You want to take your helmet off, and breathe the sweet air of your home planet.
		//KerbinSrfLanded = You look around at the planet Kerbin around you, taking everything in. You suddenly think to yourself, "What am I still doing here, space is up there!"
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Jeb... is that you biting my leg?
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Hey look, water!
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = This is not the same thing as the blue stuff above us.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = This suit was obviously not intended for scuba diving.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming in front of your helmet and you start asking yourself: "What would happen if my suit wasn't waterproof?"
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Another water landing. You feel fortunate that the EVA suits double as emergency flotation devices.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = You feel very floaty...
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Good thing these spacesuits act like flotation devices.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = It's like training in the pool.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = As the water rushes to your face, you begin to thrash and wail and gasp, and then remember your suit is airtight.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = What are those creatures circling below?
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Now I really wish I knew how to swim!
		//KerbinFlyingLow = I'm free! Free falling.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Flying this close to the ground is definitely not over-rated!
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Get back in! Quick!
		//KerbinFlyingLow = The ground is looking awful close. Did you pack a parachute?
		//KerbinFlyingLow = This isn't that high up after all...
		//KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You might be OK for a few minutes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Can I go back in now? Please?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Uh, why did we think this EVA was a good idea, again?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = More like EXTREME Vehicular Activity, am I right?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You imagine yourself as an intrepid explorer, daring to push back the boundaries of the unknown...then you look out the window and see your mother. (Sigh) Hi mom.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The wind blowing through the vast hills and valleys of grass reminds you of waves on the surface of the ocean.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = You've successfully played hide and seek with Mission Control. Crap.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! I'M IN SPACE!
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = "Why isn't there any noise? Is something wrong with my spacesuit?"
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = WHEEEEEEE!
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Mom calls, wondering where you are and when you'll be home for dinner.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = You wonder why you left your hot dog at Mission Control.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = I wonder how the lights turn on and off?
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = You think you see a something moving on the Mun's surface. You are officially terrified.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = You realize you forgot to eat lunch.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = This never gets old. It kinda makes you want to... break into song.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there's nothing you can do.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = It's so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "If you're hearing this, it means you're taking a long time on this spacewalk. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lone Kerbal loves it out here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = It crosses your mind that a thin layer of Mylar and glass is the only thing separating you from nothing.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Staring down at tiny Kerbin, it strikes you as a planet that looks mostly harmless.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see my house from here!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the frosty peaks of the planet below, and contemplate the meaning of life.  And the integrity of your spacesuit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Highlands must be so jealous of you right now.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder why so much ice is built up around each pole...then again, you can't really think of a better place for it.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = All of Kerbin stretches out before you.  You wonder what is happening far away on the rolling hills below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you conduct your EVA you use the Grasslands of Kerbin as a visual reference point to keep from getting confused.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = If you squint really hard and press your thumb against the glass, you can almost pretend that the Badlands don't exist!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at the beautiful blue ball that is your home-world, you wonder who screwed up and made the Badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Memories of Kerbin's deserts keep you warm as you work in the cold depths of outer space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float peacefully high above the great mountains of Kerbin, you feel content in your choice of careers.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're in space! Take that Kraken!  Who's laughing now, huh???
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The coldness of outer space is a sharp contrast to the warmth-filled memories of your time on Kerbin's shores.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You do a somersault and a back-flip from the hatch onto the side of the ship. How do you like THAT KSC?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Here you are, crossing the gulf between the stars. Much like the ancient sailors who braved the journey across the seas. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, look at that view. Now if only we could figure out how to pack snacks in these suits.
