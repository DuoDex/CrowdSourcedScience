		KerbinSrfLanded = Finally. Time to stretch your legs!
		KerbinSrfLanded = I wish I had brought pants.
		KerbinSrfLanded = It seems we are on our home planet.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You want to take your helmet off, and breathe the sweet air of your home planet.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Jeb... is that you biting my leg?
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Hey look, water!
		KerbinSrfSplashed = This is not the same thing as the blue stuff above us.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = This suit was obviously not intended for scuba diving.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming in front of your helmet and you start asking yourself: "What would happen if my suit wasn't waterproof?"
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Another water landing. You feel fortunate that the EVA suits double as emergency flotation devices.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You feel very floaty...
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Good thing these spacesuits act like flotation devices.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = It's like training in the pool.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = As the water rushes to your face, you begin to thrash and wail and gasp, and then remember your suit is airtight.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = What are those creatures circling below?
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Now I really wish I knew how to swim!
		KerbinFlyingLow = I'm free! Free falling.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Flying this close to the ground is definitely not over-rated!
		KerbinFlyingLow = Get back in! Quick!
		KerbinFlyingLow = The ground is looking awful close. Did you pack a parachute?
		KerbinFlyingLow = This isn't that high up after all...
		KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You might be OK for a few minutes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You've successfully played hide and seek with Mission Control. Crap.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! I'M IN SPACE!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Why isn't there any noise? Is something wrong with my spacesuit?"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = WHEEEEEEE!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Mom calls, wondering where you are and when you'll be home for dinner.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You wonder why you left your hot dog at Mission Control.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = I wonder how the lights turn on and off?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You think you see a something moving on the Mun's surface. You are officially terrified.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You realize you forgot to eat lunch.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = This never gets old. It kinda makes you want to... break into song.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there's nothing you can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It's so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "If you're hearing this, it means you're taking a long time on this spacewalk. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lone Kerbal loves it out here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = It crosses your mind that a thin layer of Mylar and glass is the only thing separating you from nothing.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Staring down at tiny Kerbin, it strikes you as a planet that looks mostly harmless.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see my house from here!
