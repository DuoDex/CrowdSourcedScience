		//KerbinSrfLanded = The Goo hides in a corner of its container.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The Goo looks to be doing the "potty dance". It should have gone back on the launchpad.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo is crammed into one side of the canister as the speeds increase.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hear a faint, distorted guitar riff coming from The Goo.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Mystery Goo almost seems...eager. You decide you don't really want to know why.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo swishes around its container. You stop yourself from taking a sip despite the lack of onboard drinks.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo is a jiggly pyramid.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be scared of heights.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A particularly stupid bird slams into your craft and is quickly absorbed by the Goo.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems disappointed in your flying skills.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The surface looks like it could use a drink. You wonder what would happen if you pour the Goo out the window.

		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo ripples its surface in a fair imitation of the terrain below.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A bird flies into the Goo, which disturbs it rather violently.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be enjoying the refreshing breeze now that you opened the container.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo holds on to the container lid for dear life. It appears as though you are caught in a life-or-death struggle.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo seems to be shrinking away from the sight of the landscape below. You don't know if this is normal, or if you should be feeding it more snacks.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo is...definitely doing something. You scribble something to that effect in your report, serene in the knowledge that you're not the one who has to read it.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what would happen if you made an entire mountain out of Goo.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo slowly jiggles in its container as the thin atmosphere buffets its surface.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what would happen if you fill one of those valleys with Goo. For science.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo is thrilled to feel the wind whipping through its hair. Its hair? But it's Goo, it doesn't have hair. In any case, the Goo seems ecstatic.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Mystery Goo-based precipitation, now there's a thought. Did you just solve Kerbin's desertification problem?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo appears to be heating up. A lot.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo tries to fly away but since it lacks wings or thrusters, it fails.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You regard the Goo uneasily as it seems to be stretching out in the container as if it is reaching for space. Or maybe it's just imitating a blade of grass.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* 'Bad, Bad, Leroy Brown. Badder than the...'. Oh yeah, science. The mystery goo remains dark and mysterious.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo has formed into a small pocket mold at the base of the container.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo is wearing sunglasses. You wonder where it got them from.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo sends a little piece of itself flopping over the side. Someone on the ground is about to get a little surprise.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo looks particularly dark and brooding here.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The globules of the Goo wobble as they bounce around inside the canister.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You hope taxpayers won't find out how much observing the Goo in space costs.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to have happily curled into a ball, utterly uninterested in the planet below.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to have formed into the shape of a sphere.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo suddenly forms itself into a scale replica of Kerbin, accurately reflecting the visible biomes below. You didn't know it could do that.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo flickers once every few minutes as stray cosmic rays strike the canister.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo is forming into the shape of an odd looking egg.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You contemplate the Goo as the Goo contemplates the kerbals on the surface contemplating you. Strange.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo takes this opportunity to shake the sand out of its fur. Wait...since when did the Goo have fur?!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be eyeing the snack you are holding. "Bad Goo, that's my tasty snack!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo is playing with the rock you brought from the Highlands.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be leaking out of the container. You knew we should have used titanium for those things.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo is holding on to the inside of the container, and you're unable to open it. You record the Goo as being "uncooperative".
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be trying to imitate the shape of a mountain. You wonder why.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You and the Goo sit in companionable silence as you gaze out over Kerbin's mountaintops. Then you shove it back inside its canister before it makes your capsule slimy.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo makes a splashing sound as you open the container, and you are reminded of the Shores of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You tell the Goo stories about your fun beach adventures. It decides to share its own but you can't understand what it's saying.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo immediately stops what it's doing when you peek inside the canister. Very suspicious.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be cavitating at 33.47652 MHz. Strange. You wonder what that means.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder what would happen if you mixed the Goo with Koolaid powder. An experiment for another day.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you spot Kerbin's oceans from the viewport, you decide to tell the Goo an old joke about a one-armed pirate and his pet jellyfish.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You let the Goo out. It seems to like space as much as you do. Maybe it wants to grow up to be an astronaut.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = After having yet another box of snacks you decide to check on the Goo and find it spilled all over the floor. See, this is why we can't have nice things.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look at the Goo pensively, wondering what secrets its inky depths hold. And whether there are any snacks in there.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You and the Goo keep each other company as you pass high over Kerbin's land and sea.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you stare blankly at the Goo you wonder if there is anti-Goo somewhere, spinning in the opposite direction.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you open the Goo canister high over Kerbin's mountain ranges, you worry that it might not want to go back in this time.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to pulse with dull flashes of colour. Is it mimicking an aurora?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems happy, but mildly reticent of your current location.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You find your hand covered in the Goo after you realize you were daydreaming about snacks again. You sure hope this stuff washes off.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You join the Goo in fraternal contemplation of the majesty of the Highlands from outer space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo waves goodbye to the planet of its birth. Not to be outdone, you do the same, only with both hands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to be leaning out of the container to get a better view of the surface below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to be taking a perverse satisfaction at the lifelessness of outer space. You nervously try to stay out of its sight.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo appears to vibrate merrily.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The Goo is feeling real chill.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You poke the Goo, and some of it gets stuck to your finger. You quickly rub it off on your spacesuit, glad that you don't have to clean up at the end of this mission.
