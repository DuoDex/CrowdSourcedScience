		KerbinSrfLanded = Huh, the gravity here is exactly the same as at Jeb's house.  Who'd have guessed.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The instrument starts sparking and shorts out before you can take a reading.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in. What a surprise!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gravity seems to be incredibly high for a celestial body of this size. It must be composed of an extremely dense material.
