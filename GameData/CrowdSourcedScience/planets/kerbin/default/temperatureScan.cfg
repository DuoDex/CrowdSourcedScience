		//KerbinSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Your science report text here.
		
		//KerbinSrfLanded = The temperature here is 'normal'. Guess the calibration worked.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = The engineers hadn't planned on water, so the numbers have all washed off the thermometer, making it unreadable.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = The atmospheric drag causes a measurable increase in temperature.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It is definitely cooler here than on the surface of Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = 82. Or is that 28? They never did tell you which side of this thing is up.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The thermometer is hanging on to the capsule by only one corner, and you are afraid if you touch it it will go flying off. We should have used the super-glue instead of the OK-glue.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You resist the urge to place your craft into a steep dive just to see how fast the thermometer changes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Mission Control declares that they can't distinguish your craft from the background ambient temperature. This is a problem since your engines are currently firing...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = What is it about height that makes things colder?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this altitude, the warmth of the beach is a thing of the past.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It is chilly up here in the thin wisps of the upper atmosphere. You report this to KSC, and they laugh back something about being happy they aren't in your shoes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature reads -10, but in reality it is probably lower because that is as low as the thermometer can read.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature outside is well into the negatives. You are silently thankful for you climate-controlled spacesuit.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It appears to be the perfect snack-eating temperature. You open a box just to be sure. For science.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Sitting inside your climate-controlled cockpit, you find that you don't really care what the thermometer thinks of the outside temperature. 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature scan is inconclusive, but you bet it's chilly out there. You tell KSC about your supposition.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You specifically bought one of those fancy low-gravity thermometers for this experiment.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature readings fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Seriously? You want to know the temperature now? We're in space; who cares!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The residual heat of the spacecraft masks the coldness of the empty vacuum of space.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Well, not much heat to measure here.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As usual the thermometer here is unreliable. You write down its reading anyway for the scientists back at KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Thermometer reading? Check. Space is cold? Check. Time for a snack? Check!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Space is cold everywhere. Unless you are facing the sun or a supernova. Hey! We should go check out one of THOSE!!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Snacks fall out of your mouth and garble your speech as you try to read off the temperature. KSC just regards it as a bad radio transmission, and waits for your next report.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = And the temperature is: perfect for snacking! So how about a few snacks, and then we'll send this report off to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you look down over the majestic mountains below you take yet another temperature reading. Stupid science. At least the view is nice.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = In high space over the planet, thermal back radiation from the warm planet is much diminished.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The temperature is even lower than it would be if you were down in the Ice Caps. At least there's no wind chill.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Roses are red, violets are blue (apparently), the mountains are pretty, and space is cold." Mission Control doesn't seem to appreciate your poetry.
