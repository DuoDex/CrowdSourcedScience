		KerbinSrfLanded = The temperature here is 'normal'.  Guess the calibration worked.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The engineers hadn't planned on water, so the numbers have all washed off the thermometer, making it unreadable.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The atmospheric drag causes a measurable increase in temperature.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It is definitely cooler here than on the surface of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature readings fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
