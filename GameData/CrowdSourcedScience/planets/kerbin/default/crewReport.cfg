		//KerbinSrfLanded = Um, did we actually go anywhere? This looks awfully familiar.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = No! Not the water!
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = The crew highly doubts the floating capabilities of this craft.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming by the window. It looks like you are under water.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = "Crew reporting in. We'll get back to you… about to eat lunch."
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You are almost in an orbit with your home planet.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what is down there on the surface. If only you had some binoculars.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = A golf ball pings against the side of the spaceship.  How the heck did someone hit a ball that hard??
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You can't smell the cows anymore.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* "Colorado Rocky Mountain high. I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky". Ah, good 'ol John Denver.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You feel a certain satisfaction at being higher than the Highlands.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You stare out the window in deep thought, pondering the answer to the ultimate question, before being rudely interrupted by the Mission Control.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your craft they had once held in place.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You're in space and not dead. The crew and Mission Control have agreed that it's indeed a big step forward.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to micro-gravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = After rigorous testing, the crew has determined that micro-gravity increases the fun of bouncy balls by 200%.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "This is why we need fancy suits, huh?"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Even from space the vast swaths of grass appear a technicolor green.  You feel proud to have come from such a beautiful place.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You marvel at how beautifully-manicured kerbalkind's lawn is.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = This is Major Kerman to Mission Control, I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It's time to leave the capsule... right?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = From this altitude, you realize that you'll pass over the Badlands several times per hour. This worries you more than it should.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like my globe!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Hey, I can see Jeb's Ego from here!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Yep, we're in space alright, but you bet that if we left the landing gear down it would hit that mountaintop.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You feel dizzy, unable to keep your head from spinning. If you are going to build a larger crew pod, a web of ropes inside might be of help.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You are chatting to Mission Control when your radio channel is interrupted by some guy named Major Tom frantically saying something has gone wrong. You tell him take a protein pill and put his helmet on.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You kill some time chatting with a random radio operator.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The command console reads: "Welcome to space. Please enjoy your stay."
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew is reading books to pass the time.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Just a little bit further to go!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Bail out!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Don't bail out!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Do we have enough fuel to make it into real space?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = If you rotate the craft, we might end up aerobraking...
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you gaze down on your home planet, you are simultaneously filled with wonder and amazed that you made it this far without exploding.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Here you are sitting in a tin can, far above the world.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Space? SPACE! SPAAACCCCCE!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You never get tired of the view from space, even flying over this part of the planet.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You think that KSC may be somewhere below the clouds.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Almost back to KSC. Just an atmosphere and a few thousand kilometers between us.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From up here, the desert and the oceans look like one giant beach! Beaches are fun!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The spacecraft's crew and some of the guys at Mission Control are playing chess over the radio.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look out the window only to realize you forgot your keys at home.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Did you remember to pack your Agoraphobia medication?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Log: The alien planet seems remarkably similar to our own. Oh wait..."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder at the fact that Kerbin is mostly green.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Agoraphobia sets in...
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You really are high as a kite, rocket-man. Maybe higher.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Bound for the stars.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You think about all the great times you had hanging out on the shores below. Anyway, hasn't it been a while since we had some snacks??
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From space, everything looks like a giant beach! Especially the actual beaches!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You observe the  Highlands from orbit, marveling at how tiny they look.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You become homesick thinking about the mountains of Kerbin being the closest part of the planet to you at this altitude. Then you have some snacks, and it's all better.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You count the snowstorms passing over the Tundra below and are suddenly glad you don't have to be down there.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is that Tundra below? You are so far from the planet that you can only make a wild guess. So you do, and report it as solid fact back to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Your slide rule breaks, and you begin to search for your backup before realizing that you don't know how to use a slide rule anyway.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You swear you saw a blue police box flashing away on a retrograde orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Let's engage Warp Drive... wait, we don't have Warp Drive?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Everything looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = KSC, I hope you know where I am, cause I just spilled coffee on the roadmap.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ooh that aurora is pretty! Wonder what it looks like from the ground?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there's nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The planet appears to be round! It's not flat like we thought!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You strain to see detail on the surface below, but all that you can see are the broad strokes of biomes below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You hope that when you come back, you'll land in the Grasslands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can barely make out the ridges of Kerbin's mountains from this altitude, but enjoy a few snacks with the view.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From this distance, Kerbin's mountain ranges blend into one big blob.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down over the vast ocean below and wonder how many glasses it would take to empty all that water.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From here Kerbin looks like a smooth blue marble. You never were good at that game.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you watch the great blue seas of Kerbin pass by you wonder what lays hidden in the depths.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, that ocean really is big.  You're glad you aren't trying to sail across it.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you watch Kerbin's oceans from the depths of outer space you ask KSC if there are space pirates. KSC assures you that pirate ships have sails instead of rockets and thus cannot achieve orbit.
