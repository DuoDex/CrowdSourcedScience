		//KerbinSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a fine day today.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Looks like a storm will arrive later.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = The pressure is lower here than it was at ground level.
		KerbinFlyingLow = After several minutes of displaying nothing, the sensor briefly registers a value!
		KerbinFlyingLow = One Hundred Million Pascals. That can't be right.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You remember that barometers are often used to forecast the weather. You examine the readings and decide that it might not be a good idea to be here in the next few hours.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The dial keeps spinning round and round. After consulting with Mission Control, you scribble a zero at the end of each of the measurements. The dial immediately points to the largest one.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Instead of sending Mission Control your barometer data, you just send them a copy of this morning's weather report.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Barometric pressure: 300 millibars. Or is that 3000? Whatever....look at the view down there.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Your blood pressure rises as you see just how close you are flying to the icy terrain below. The barometric pressure, in contrast, remains steady.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Despite the fact that you are flying low over the surface, the reading is no lower than usual.
		KerbinFlyingLow = *singing* "Under pressure. Ba da dum, ba da da dum, Ba da da dum, ba da da dum. Under pressure".
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer shakes and shimmies so much in the atmosphere that you are unable to get an accurate reading.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Readings seem nominal. Snack time!
		KerbinFlyingLow = The barometer seems to be questioning its own existence.  Well, at least you agree on something.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = There is still atmospheric pressure even this far from the surface.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Did the device malfunction, or is this not a 'true' vacuum?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It reads -3. Huh, that's funny. Oh well, they can figure it out back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Glancing at the display, you shake your head and feel sorry for anyone who lives down there.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = "The weather will remain pleasant," declares the barometer.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it snack time yet? It has to be snack time. No pressure readings till after snack time.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The air is too thin for the barometer to function. Much like how the air is too cold for a kerbal to function.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer is covered in ice crystals at this altitude, and you are unable to get a good reading.  Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
	        KerbinFlyingHigh = Despite the fact that you are flying high over the surface, the reading is no higher than usual.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = In the thin, wispy layers of the upper atmosphere a barometer reading is not particularly useful.  You take the reading anyway and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer data you transmit back to KSC barely qualifies as a proper reading.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this altitude, a barometer scan is almost purely a formality.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Pressure is nominal. Nothing to see here folks. Move along.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer here seems nominal. What's not nominal is the amount of snacks we haven't eaten yet. You radio KSC about this issue.
