		//KerbinSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//KerbinSrfLanded = Why are we performing this experiment here? We could have just stayed at home and done it.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a rubber duck float out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Some of the materials get sucked out the bay door when you accidentally open the door. You plan on blaming a seagull when they land on someone below.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The lab is in complete disarray after hitting turbulence.
		KerbinFlyingLow = A particularly persistent bird is following you around, perhaps attracted by the smell emanating from your exposed samples.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The lab seems to be picking up some of the dry, dusty particles from the surface as you fly so close to the ground.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Your low-altitude flight is kicking up a lot of dust. That can't be good for the samples.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You find it difficult to concentrate on your lab research flying this close to the terrain. You write down some random gibberish to send back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hope the autopilot keeps you from crashing into any stray hills as you play with the materials lab.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Materials are strewn across the lab as the ship performs a mostly-expected gravity turn.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Woohoooo! We're sciencing!
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The materials in the lab are viscous and difficult to work with. After struggling for a while you write up the data that you can, ready for the folks back at KSC.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You make note to bring a climate-controlled materials lab next time. The one you currently have appears to be frozen solid.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The samples are shivering too hard for you to get any useful science out of them.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Almost above the mountains and into space. When we get there we should have some snacks. You know, as a reward for awesomeness.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You're quite certain the hills of the Highlands don't grow this high and so you are able to relax and focus on your experiment.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere buffets the side of the lab, distracting you as you write your lab report.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder if that half sandwich you left in the fridge at home is still there, as you write up yet another lab report. When will the reports end and the sandwiches begin??
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You prepare the lab for both reentry and deep space travel, since you don't remember which direction you're headed.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Your lab report contains nothing out of the ordinary, but you write it up for the scientists back at KSC anyway.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You sneak long glances out the window as you wait for the experiments to complete.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = In your lab report, you include a note asking Mission Control to send you someplace warmer next time.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = With all the experiments well underway you grab a box of snacks, wishing it was bigger than it is.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = All of the materials are still wet from the mishap-that-shall-not-be-named earlier. You jot down some random numbers and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The view from the lab is particularly distracting today, and you find it takes an extra hour to complete your report.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, didn't we used to have a microwave in this lab? How are we supposed to get good results when we cant properly heat up our snacks?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples barely react other than giving a small shudder.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You play music as you write your lab report. It reminds you of your home amidst Kerbin's grassy plains.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = LLLLAAAABBBB RRRREEEEPPPPOOOORRRRTTTT IIIINNNN SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE!!!! Ahem, yes, everything is nominal.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You pull out your trusty lab notebook to make a note of what you observe. After 2 minutes of searching for a pencil you remember you are in space now, and find it floating in a corner.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You perform your experiments with a rock from the Highlands as a guest of honor.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You finish your lab work, write up the report, and pull out the snacks. Job well done!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The light reflects off the surface of the planet below as you stare out the window. Oh yeah....science. You finish writing up your report for the kerbals back at KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You quickly slam the door shut on the lab after peeking in. It doesn't look good in there, to say the least.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the bay doors, a sample floats out, heavily convulsing and making high pitched noises via radio. Mission Control denies your request to kill it with fire.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples begins to float out of the main chamber. You manage to close the doors, but not before losing a few to the endless void. You wonder how the lab techs will feel about this.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The materials seem to float through empty...space. That's it! We must be in space!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Low-gravity experiments in space over Kerbin. Just another day for a kerbonaut.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab has a certain 'vacuuminess' to it here. You note that in the report to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Some of your samples create interesting refractions as they are exposed to the sunlight reflecting from the blue waters of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write down your lab report you visually confirm that Kerbin's oceans do indeed make up the majority of its surface.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab shimmers blue in the reflected light from Kerbin's ocean below. Or maybe you're just delirious from lack of snacks.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You are unable to properly finish your lab report. The sight of all the water below you keeps making you get up and go to the bathroom.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You finally finish writing a disgustingly long lab report. Oh well, at least your office has a good view.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The air in the lab seems stale and cramped even though you are far above the planet. You wonder why.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ah a quiet journey, a mouthful of snacks, and a beautiful view of Kerbin's mountain ranges! If it wasn't for the lab report you have to write, this would be the perfect moment. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You think you glimpse KSC out the window as you finish up your lab report.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = A frozen glowing squid has just floated out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You write something suitably scientific and go back to watching the auroras swirl about the Ice Caps.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lab has a certain serenity flying so high above the planet. There is no place you'd rather be right now.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you finish your lab experiments one of the massive peaks below catches your eye. It's amazing how small things look from way up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write up your lab report, you marvel at how smooth Kerbin looks despite the Highlands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You brought along some dirt from Kerbin's Grasslands for this experiment. You're not really sure what to do with it though.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Far below there is a biome of some sort. You are too far away from the planet to tell which one, though. We need better facilities in this lab.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down at the surface through the lab window as you process results from your latest experiment. Kerbin looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gel samples shrink, boil and freeze simultaneously when exposed to the hard vacuum of space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You take your little ball of sand from Kerbin's desert and let it loose into outer space. You fondly imagine it growing up and one day becoming a mighty asteroid! Then you remember what asteroids tend to do to inhabited planets and desperately try to gather it back up.
