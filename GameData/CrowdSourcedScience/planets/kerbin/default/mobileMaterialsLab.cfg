		KerbinSrfLanded = Why are we performing this experiment here? We could have just stayed at home and done it.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a rubber duck float out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Some of the materials get sucked out the bay door when you accidentally open the door.  You plan on blaming a seagull when they land on someone below.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Woohoooo! We're sciencing!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the bay doors, a sample floats out, heavily convulsing and making high pitched noises via radio. Mission Control denies your request to kill it with fire.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples begins to float out of the main chamber. You manage to close the doors, but not before losing a few to the endless void. You wonder how the lab techs will feel about this.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = A frozen glowing squid has just floated out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gel samples shrink, boil and freeze simultaneously when exposed to the hard vacuum of space.
