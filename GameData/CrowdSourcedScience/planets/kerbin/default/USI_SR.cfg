		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//KerbinSrfLanded = Meteorological data matches the surface average on Kerbin. Which is where you are, coincidentally.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Humidity levels are off the charts! This must be the end of days! The biblical flood! Oh wait, it just landed in the ocean. I knew that.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Precipitation appears to be negligible. You know this because the rocket isn't wet.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The sounding rocket reports an incoming storm front! You hope that it manages to land before then.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The extreme altitude gives insight into atmospheric tides caused by the Mun.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Fragmented wind currents of the surface are replaced by large-scale circulations.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The air is very thin up here, but posesses interesting and unique meteorology of its own.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = There's not enough air to turn the anemometer, but other sensors record a wealth of high-altitude data.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It's a vacuum, and you want to do meteorology on it how exactly?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The spacecraft vents some gas, sending the meteorology equipment momentarily crazy.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Unfortunately, the sounding rocket isn't gathering much in the way of meteorological data here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The sensors weren't designed for deep space and spin uselessly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You're just as confused as the sensor is about why you are tying to do meteorology out here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = No meteorological data here. Good job getting a sounding rocket this far out though.

		//KerbinSrfLanded = You know no more about aeronomy than you did before this experiment.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Note to self: water-proof the aeronomy compartment.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = The sensors detect regular shifts in atmospheric pressure. It is oddly similar to the way ocean tides work. 
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The data you receive from this experiment goes a long way towards explaining electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Faint wisps of plasta are detected emanating from a distant electric storm.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Radiation count is significantly higher up here, but there's barely a whiff of solar wind.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The upper atmosphere is a paradise for aeronomy. You feel a sense of smugness over the boffins in the lab stuck down on the ground.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Atmospheric tides induce subtle but regular shifts in atmospheric pressure with the positions of the Sun and Mun.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The aeronomical instruments are confused and disoriented. Where'd the atmosphere go?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Aeronomy is supposed to be done up high, but not this high!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The atmosphere supposedly ends lower than this, but the vanishingly faint tendrils of gas suggest otherwise.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The aeronomical compartment wasn't designed for operation in vacuum conditions.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = There might be no air, but there's certaianly no shortage of ions streaming off the atmosphere.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You take the opportunity while the rocket floats in space to organise the data it produced earlier.

		//KerbinSrfLanded = You're not gonna learn much about your material samples from here.
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = This data will help us develop materials that are water-tight and resistant to corrosion.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = This experiment will increase our understanding of how aerodynamic forces interact with a variety of different materials.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this height, materials must be able to withstand large temperature shifts and possibly even lightning strikes.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Looks like the materials scientists did a good job, because nothing's broken yet.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You're more worried about the condition of the cardboard box than the materials themselves.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Some of the polymers were expected to crack from the rapid temperature and pressure changed, but they are all still intact.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Studying how materials behave here is only one piece of the puzzle, and going to Kerbin's extreme environments is also fo significant worth.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = At this altitude, we can test material reactions to reentry heat and vacuum conditions.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You release a couple of samples from the box, and hope they stay in space for long-duration exposure tests.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = With no air to buffer tempertures, materials experience huge temperature swings and need to withstand rapid expansion and contraction.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Solar radiation, together with the vacuum environment and tempertaure swings, is very harsh on organic materials and polymers.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're gonna be spending a lot of time here. So it's important to know what materials can do the job.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You argue with Mission Control over whether or not the fact that something can get up here means it can survive properly.

		//KerbinSrfLanded = It's not gonna take a rocket scientist to analyze the results from this experiment...
		//KerbinSrfSplashed = Data from this experiment will go a long way towards ensuring spacecraft integrity during splashdown landings.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Sounding rockets are excellent test platforms for this experiment. You are able to subject the craft to stresses that would be inconceivable if there was a Kerbal on-board.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The engineers back at KSC are curious about the effects a lightning strike may have on a craft.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rushing, thin air generates a large static charge on the craft. The components crackle with energy.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Plasma around the craft interferes with communication between KSC and the rocket.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Everything seems to be working all right in the thin air. Mostly, at least.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rarefied atmosphere, radiation and electricity don't seem to have much effect. More height is needed!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Temperatures in some of the high-power components increase markedly with the lack of air to conduct away waste heat.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = R&D wants you to go even higher. You're not sure why, but you put it on the todo list.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = After carefully going over the data, the KSC engineering department asks for the budget to build a vacuum chamber.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The engineers are now confident that they'll soon be able to build a craft that can carry a kerbonaut far beyond Kerbin's atmosphere.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The onboard computer crashes as solar radiation flips a memory bit. Any sensitive electronics will need shielding.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Curiously, compasses still seem to function in the lower sections of high space. Kerbin's magnetic field must extend far above the ground.
