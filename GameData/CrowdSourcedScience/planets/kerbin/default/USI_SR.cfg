		KerbinSrfLanded = Meteorological data matches the surface average on Kerbin. Which is where you are, coincidentally.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Humidity levels are off the charts! This must be the end of days! The biblical flood! Oh wait, it just landed in the ocean. I knew that.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Precipitation appears to be negligible. You know this because the rocket isn't wet.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The sounding rocket reports an incoming storm front! You hope that it manages to land before then.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Unfortunately, the sounding rocket isn't gathering much in the way of meteorological data here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = No meteorological data here. Good job getting a sounding rocket this far out though.

		KerbinSrfLanded = You know no more about aeronomy than you did before this experiment.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Note to self: water-proof the aeronomy compartment.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The sensors detect regular shifts in atmospheric pressure. It is oddly similar to the way ocean tides work. 
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The data you receive from this experiment goes a long way towards explaining electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The aeronomical instruments are confused and disoriented. Where'd the atmosphere go?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The aeronomical compartment wasn't designed for operation in vacuum conditions.

		KerbinSrfLanded = You're not gonna learn much about your material samples from here.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = This data will help us develop materials that are water-tight and resistant to corrosion.
		KerbinFlyingLow = This experiment will increase our understanding of how aerodynamic forces interact with a variety of different materials.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = At this height, materials must be able to withstand large temperature shifts and possibly even lightning strikes.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = At this altitude, we can test material reactions to reentry heat and vacuum conditions.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're gonna be spending a lot of time here. So it's important to know what materials can do the job.

		KerbinSrfLanded = It's not gonna take a rocket scientist to analyze the results from this experiment...
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Data from this experiment will go a long way towards ensuring spacecraft integrity during splashdown landings.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Sounding rockets are excellent test platforms for this experiment. You are able to subject the craft to stresses that would be inconceivable if there was a Kerbal on-board.
		KerbinFlyingHigh =  The engineers back at KSC are curious about the effects a lightning strike may have on a craft.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = After carefully going over the data, the KSC engineering department asks for the budget to build a vacuum chamber.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The engineers are now confident that they'll soon be able to build a craft that can carry a kerbonaut far beyond Kerbin's atmosphere.
