		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you'd expect from a thriving space program.
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The sensor picks up fear and excitement in the atmosphere.  Don't ask how.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The atmosphere is always tense here.  You didn't need a sensor to figure that out.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Atmospheric conditions look good for takeoff. Punch it!
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The sensor registers a cool breeze coming from the spaceplane hangar.  We always knew this was a cool place.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The atmosphere here is pure awesomesauce.  Really.  It doesn't get much better. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The sensor notes the slight venturi effect of the wind whipping around the SPH tank.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = The sensor cannot determine the wind direction with all the tanks around. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower =  The sensor reads less wind at the bottom of the tower than at the top. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The staff at the tracking station shoo you off as you try to take atmospheric readings, saying that your sensor is interfering with operations.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast =  You quickly take you readings, hoping that your tests don't interfere with the sensitive electronics here. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth =  You brazenly take your atmospheric readings, not caring less whether or not you are interfering with tracking operations. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = Quick, run! The tracking operators are running toward you with pitchforks for interfering with operations.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You lock the door of the tracking station from the outside, knowing that the operators inside will be furious when your atmospheric test equipment interferes with tracking operations.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The atmosphere here is abuzz with activity day and night. 
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = The atmosphere here is always cool.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The atmosphere here is somber.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = You find yourself circling around the tank looking for a good place to set up your equipment.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The tanks block the sensor from any useful analysis.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The atmosphere here is very contemplative.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = All the blow-hards around here have caused the anemometer to fall off your instrument.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = The researchers confiscate your atmospheric sensor and disassemble it to see how it works. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = Having duct-taped your sensor back together you attempt to get an atmospheric reading, but it looks like your fix will require some bubblegum, superglue, and maybe a coat hanger as well.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = The sensor picks up faint traces of caffeine in the air.  Makes sense with the hours that the R&D team puts in.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The atmosphere here is thick with fumes of unknown chemicals from unknown reactions.  Who would have known this R&D stuff could be dangerous?
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The atmosphere is heavy with an acrid smell.  Who knows what those mad scientists are working on. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = The strange chemical concoction leaking from the tanks melts your atmospheric sensors into a puddle of goo.  Hey look! It's not-as-much-of-a mystery goo!
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The sensor blew away. Duh. It's a wind tunnel.  At least we got the grant money already.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Apparently, the atmosphere is made of ash and rocket fuel. But that might be because you're on the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = I think a fly just got in the research equipment... don't tell the scientists!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The extremely expensive array of sensors, samplers, and detectors has confirmed that today is a very good day to go to space. Which is nice, considering we already have the rocket out and everything.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The sensor detects an explosive atmosphere. Try getting off the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You install the sensor on top of the flag pole.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The sensor tells you that the flag is working as advertised.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The atmosphere heats up as Montimer learns about how our funds have been spend lately.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = It's surprisingly windy out in the open.
		KerbinFlyingLowKSC = Atmosphere analysis??? Let's worry about flying this thing first!
		KerbinFlyingHighKSC = The sensor picks up the distinct signature of rocket flight: traces of unburned hypergolics and hydrocarbons.
