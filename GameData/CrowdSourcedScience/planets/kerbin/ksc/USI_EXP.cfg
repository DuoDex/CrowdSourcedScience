		//KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your science report text here.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Pictures of the KSC will be useful for assessing damage should it occur. When it occurs, that is.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = You don't even need to zoom to see the lines on Mortimer's face.
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = Now would be a good opportunity for a promotional photoshoot for a recruitment ad. Say cheese, everyone!
		KerbinSrfLandedCrwalerway = You're more worried about keeping your expensive camera equipment out of the way of the Crawler.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The pictures must be so much better from the top of that.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You propose leaving the camera on the pad to record the launch.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The tripod appears to be getting in the way of the controllers' vital work. Perhaps it would be better to move on.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The long, straight strip of concrete shimmering in the heat makes one's eyes water.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The engineers seem much more interested in the craft the camera is on, and come over to try and disassemble it.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = The interior of the hangar is cavernous, and has a great echo for audio effect.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = The tank falling over and rolling through the KSC would make an excellent disaster short.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = Why would anyone want a picture of a bunch of tanks of jet fuel?
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = The top of the tower would have very commanding views, but you don't fancy lugging the camera up there.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = You make a mental note to leave a timelapse camera out here later.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = Click. Whirr. Is it the dish, or the camera making the noise?
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = The complex bearing machinery would make the subject of a very interesting documentary segment.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = Tracking Station staff ask you to use the camera to inspect the state of the dish.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = That looks like a lot of very complicated and fragile equipment in there. Best to stay out.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The massive structure looms imposingly over the rest of the KSC.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = High up in the towering structure, you see another camera being mounted to a spacecraft. Are you going to be replaced?
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = Anyone viewing the photograph is filled with a sense of reverence and nostalgia, even though nobody actually remembers what it's a memorial for.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = It's dark inside, but the bonging noises it makes and the camera's night-vision tell you it's empty.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = One of the tanks has sprung a leak. You can't choose between dutifully taking pictures and hightailing it out of there.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = It's a complex of gleaming laboratory buildings. Well, maybe not exactly gleaming, but it's a good photo regardless.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = The exterior of one of the two halves of the building doesn't match the architectural plans.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You imagine this is where naughty researchers get put in time-out as you photograph it.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = It's a big, knobbly edifice full of boffins who are currently very angry with you for bringing dirt in on the camera tripod.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = That camera is a lot bigger than yours. Pity they won't let you have a go on it.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Shouts are heard from within. Whatever accident just happened, it probably doesn't want to be photographed.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = It may be small, but it's still deserving of its own photo category.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = What exotic substances are in there? You don't want to risk the camera to find out.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = Photographing from a distance is in order here, since the scientists would probably love to put your camera in the wind tunnel.
