		//There are additional situations listed in locationslist.txt
		//KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingLowKSC = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = Your science report text here.
		
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The temperature rises as an angry Gene Kerman comes over the radio and demands to know what you're still doing there. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The temperature drops. Montimer seems pleased with our spending of funds. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The temperature here is elevated, but it's probably just due to the new recruits excitement to meet a real astronaut.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The thermometer gets crushed under the wheels of the crawler.  Oh well, time for some snacks.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You realize that the temperature drops the higher you climb the pole. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The temperature reading spikes suddenly. Did somebody start the engines? 
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The temperature here is elevated from the tense atmosphere.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The jet exhaust skews the temperature reading, and you have to throw out the results.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The temperature here is cool due to the breeze blowing through the SPH.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You are unable to concentrate on taking a reading with the screaming of jet engines in the background.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = 3.983°C - You realize there is as much water in this tower as can be. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation =  Temperature here is: bored. Oops, that's just you.  The temperature is nominal. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You position the thermometer in the direct center of the dish hoping for an exciting result.  You are disappointed as usual.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = In your boredom you drop the thermometer and break it.  No loss, it's not like there was anything worth reporting here anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = You wait in anguish for yet another temperature reading.  What's the point?
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You explain the use of real scientific instruments like the thermometer to the staff at the tracking station.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB =  The ground spontaneously combusts from years of rocket fuel soaking into it, and the temperature spikes. 
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = The area here is warmer than usual due to all the nonstop activity.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The temperature reading here is inspiring.  Or sad.  You can't decide which.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place. 
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = Seconds after being attached, the thermometer has frozen into place. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The temperature here fluctuates wildly.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = The thermometer is sucked into a wormhole by an advanced project here.  You decide to write it off.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You hide the thermometer in the corner hoping no-one will find it.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = The R&D personnel disassemble your thermometer before you can take a reading.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = You observe the temperature.  How fitting.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The temperature here is elevated due to the non-stop firing of neurons in this space.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = The size of the lab has no effect whatsoever on the temperature readings, contrary to your hypothesis.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks =  The material from the tanks oozes out onto your thermometer and dissolves it before you can get an accurate reading. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The thermometer reads minus one million degrees.  Probably from the wind chill.
