		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The weather resembles the Kerbin average with a moderate sea breeze.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Sheesh, we haven't even left the launch pad and you're already jonesing for meteorological data. Have a snack, buddy.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The weather is stormy as Mortimer sees the annual expenditure report.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The cavernous space inside the VAB generates its own weather system.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = It's stuffy and warm in the main hangar.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The hot asphalt creates large thermals.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The scientists watch you smugly, since they already know the weather conditions up to several weeks ahead.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = Don't even think about putting the anemometer in there and calling it the apocalypse.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = No special weather conditions to report.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The atmosphere is still and tense. You could cut it with a knife.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Why is the thing down here, and not on a sounding rocket?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Sheesh, we haven't even left the launch pad and you're already jonesing for aeronomical data. Have a snack, buddy.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministation = The sensor detects high levels of radiation in some mysterious floating coins that were just brought in.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The metal frame of the nearby VAB produces a noticeable static charge in the wind.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Someday, you'll mount this sensor on an aircraft and go soaring off into the upper atmosphere with it.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You're not sure whether the aeronomy kit is on an aircraft or not, but try to take off and do some real aeronomy anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = Bursts of various energies and radiation come from the buildings. Just what do they get up to in there?
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The strong RF radiation from the transmitter dishes is leaking slightly, and it's enough to spoil the readings.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = There's so much electrical equipment and unwashed hair in there you can detect the magnetic fields and static charge from here.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials sit snugly in their holders, untouched and unchanged.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Sheesh, we haven't even left the launch pad and you're already jonesing for materials data. Have a snack, buddy.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = You attempt to pinch a few items of office stationary to put in the box before being chased away by angry staff.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = This is where you'll see the fruits of your labour in the form of new and improved rocket parts!
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = You think an aircraft like the ones assembled in the hangar would be a good way to jostle the materials around and expose them to new environments.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The heat from the surface starts to melt the cheese. Come to think of it, why is there cheese in the materials box?
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = You desperately want to put the experiment results through some proper lab equipment, but your boots are muddy enough that the scientists won't let you in.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = You hunt for a long enough stick to try and toast one of the materials in one of the dish microwave beams.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission Control orders you to send the materials up instead of wandering around on the ground.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You should have brought a mini rocket to play with under the guise of testing parts.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Sheesh, we haven't even left the launch pad and you're already jonesing for engineering data. Have a snack, buddy.
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The admin team asks you to test the resilience of their new calculator. Trust them to do the strange things.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Each of those parts of the rockets under assembly in front of you will be full of parts tested this way. Well, maybe in actual space.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = No, you can't strap the box to one of the jets and do loops with it to "test the parts".
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You're sure the kerbals in the control tower are looking at the box with binoculars. Did they sneak some things into it?
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = In the window is a test chamber containing....the exact same parts? They must be trying to race you to get the data!
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The coil reveals the air is surprisingly not thick with RF radiation despite the presence of powerful nearby dishes.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = One of the electronic parts turns out to be the exact part one of the important computers in the control room needs. They didn't ask before taking it.
