		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments. Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The needle jumps and shakes violently; moments later, you hear a distant explosion. Looks like somebody let Bill into the cafeteria kitchen again.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The lack of geologic activity - explosions not counting - reminds you why they built the space center here.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates heavy surface-borne activity nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The instrument indicates high levels of seismic activity coming from...the research lab. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The needle moves. Montimer probably exploded again over the spending of funds. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = You try to impress the new recruits with the word seismometer, but you're not sure if it worked.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The Seismometer goes off the charts as the crawler slowly trundles by.
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The needle moves as you drop down the pole. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The ground trembles with the ghosts of failed launches past.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder if repeated rocket launches have caused the ground to become unstable.		 
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = All the stomping around here registers clearly on the seismometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The ground here conducts vibrations about as effectively as concrete. You report your findings to the tower, but they don't seem very impressed.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You calibrate the detector one more time before lifting off. 
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The planes are too light to register anything on the seismometer here.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Nope, still nothing. Let's have some snacks while we're bored.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You bang on the side of the tank, which registers on the seismometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = You wonder if dumping all the water will make the needle move. 
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = Nothing happening here. No big surprise.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You consider what a waste of your time taking this measurement is.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Vibrations from the moving dish overwhelm everything. Why are we even taking this measurement?
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = Ugh, more seismometer measurements. Maybe you'll be nicer to Gene next time.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You throw the seismometer at the side of the building hoping that THAT might finally register a reading.
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = All the activity at the VAB registers clearly on the seismometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = You get distracted looking at all the rockets and completely forget about taking a reading here.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = Reading: nominal. Yep, that's really it.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = You bang on the side of the tank, which registers on the seismometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The R&D scientists disassemble the seismometer for parts.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You miss the reading while explaining to one of the scientists how this thing works.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You stuff the seismometer into the corner, and hope that no one remembers it.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = The R&D scientists interpret the data from the seismometer in real time, and you realize maybe this science stuff really IS useful.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = Your observations are observed in the observatory by an observer.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The seismometer falls on its side and breaks. Oh well, time for some snacks anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab =  Despite the cramped conditions the seismometer performs perfectly and registers: absolutely nothing. 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = You recruit some friends to bang on all the tanks, and the reading goes off scale.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = As usual, your instrument gets blown away here before you can take a reading. Why do you even try?
