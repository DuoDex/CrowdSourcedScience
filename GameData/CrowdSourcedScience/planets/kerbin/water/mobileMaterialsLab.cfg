		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You take care to limit your samples' exposure to the humid sea air. Some of them are rather susceptible to corrosion.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The materials lab seems particularly damp. You pull out a mop and bucket to be safe as you finish your report.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You submerge the materials bay into the water and it comes back up with a decent haul of codfish.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been enlightening.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.
