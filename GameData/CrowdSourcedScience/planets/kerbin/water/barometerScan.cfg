		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You wish there was a setting on the barometer that warns you of sharks. 
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Surprisingly all the water didn't short out the instrument, and you are able to get a good reading to send back to KSC.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Hopefully the folks back at KSC can use this barometer data to warn you of an incoming storm.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Drops of saltwater seem to have encrusted the barometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading. You make something up randomly, and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingLow = As you write down the air pressure data you are briefly reminded of your elementary science lessons about 'The Water Cycle'. 
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer reading isn't very interesting so you look out the window and watch the waves instead.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The barometer here seems nominal.  What's not nominal is the amount of snacks we haven't eaten yet.  You radio KSC about this issue.
