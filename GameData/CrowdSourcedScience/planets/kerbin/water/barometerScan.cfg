		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Hopefully the folks back at KSC can use this barometer data to warn you of an incoming storm.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer reading isn't very interesting so you look out the window and watch the waves instead.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Surprisingly all the water didn't short out the instrument, and you are able to get a good reading to send back to KSC.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You wish there was a setting on the barometer that warns you of sharks.
