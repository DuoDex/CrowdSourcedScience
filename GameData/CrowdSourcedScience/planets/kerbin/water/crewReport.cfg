		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Arr mateys! Let's show those landlubbers at KSC who the masters of the high seas truly are!
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You don't need to worry about pirates, right? Surely they're only after regular ships not spaceships.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = I hope the hatch doesn't break and flood the pod.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You watch an Iceberg float by.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = "I can't swim!"
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Hey little guy! I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy. Come here Squishy...
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = Does our craft float? Maybe we'll get to test it.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You see a spray of water whipped up by the air rushing out of your way.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You are flying so low you notice disturbances in the water from your craft.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = From this perspective you can see the underwater topology.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You wonder if it's safe to drink the water.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = The water looks so peaceful from here.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You imagine all the wonderful creatures that live below the surface that would probably eat you. Or at least brush up against your leg while swimming.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = What's that big shadow? Is that...a kraken?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You look down over the vast ocean below and wonder how many glasses it would take to empty all that water.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = From here Kerbin looks like a smooth blue marble.  You never were good at that game.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you watch the great blue seas of Kerbin pass by you wonder what lays hidden in the depths. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, that ocean really is big.  You're glad you aren't trying to sail across it.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you watch Kerbin's oceans from the depths of outer space you ask KSC if there are space pirates. KSC assures you that pirate ships have sails instead of rockets and thus cannot achieve orbit.
