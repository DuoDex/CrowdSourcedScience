		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The graviolis aren't too sure about this wet stuff, but they report that everything else seems in order.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The graviolis are soaking wet, but they report nominal gravity.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The gravity scan detects disturbances seemingly originating from far underneath the ocean's surface...
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The sensor has detected changes in the local gravity that seem to be related to the passing of the Mun.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = As you activate the gravity scanner, you wonder what sort of effects the oceans might have on the reading.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The sensor shows a surprising variance as it passes over the oceans, hinting at what lies deep below the waters.
		KerbinInSpaceHighWater = Your gravity scan high over Kerbin's Water ends much like your other gravity scans. With a delicious snack.
		KerbinInSpaceHighWater = The smooth stream of graviolis creates a strong reading.  You send the report back to KSC for their analysis.
