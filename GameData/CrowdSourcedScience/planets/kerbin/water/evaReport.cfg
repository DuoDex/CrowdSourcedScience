		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You have trouble swimming because your helmet is more buoyant than the rest of your spacesuit.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You wonder if a shark can bite through your spacesuit. You try it yourself and fail. You hope that shark teeth aren't any sharper than yours.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You hope they made this spacesuit waterproof as well as space-proof.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You calculate the number of snacks you should bring to be able to swim to KSP.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Oh look a fishy! Then you remember what happened to your last goldfish and decide to let this one go.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You think you see a shark swimming in the water. Wait, no, that's just a landing leg.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Is that a shark over there?
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Something nibbles on your foot.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Help! Help! Where's a lifeguard when you need them?
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You hope that sharks can't jump this high.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You are so close to the waves that you can almost touch them.  KSC recommends against this, though.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You consider taking your helmet off to smell the fresh ocean breeze, but the frantic yelling over the comms from KSC convinces you otherwise.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder if you can skip yourself like a rock if you end up falling off.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = You are reminded of the myriad sailors who have been adrift in the ocean below.  And here you are, the first one adrift in space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Why are krakens such a popular topic back at KSC? Don't they live down there in the water?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Here you are, crossing the gulf between the stars. Much like the ancient sailors who braved the journey across the seas. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Wow, look at that view.  Now if only we could figure out how to pack snacks in these suits.
