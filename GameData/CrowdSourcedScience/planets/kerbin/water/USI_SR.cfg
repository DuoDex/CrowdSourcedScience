		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The weather patterns here are strongly influenced by the sea. Who'da thunk?
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = It's a little difficult to get an accurate reading for humidity when you're in the water.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You do some momentary analysis of the sea winds, but a weather balloon would be able to do much more.

		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The equipment picks up the electromagnetic emissions of the ship. Other than that, it's very quiet.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = A worrying amount of radiation is emanating from somewhere below the water. You try to ignore it.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = Salt has made the cardboard fragile, and you try to do as much science as you can before it crumbles.

		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The salt-laden sea breeze is highly corrosive to many materials.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Salty water strongly accelerates the decay of metals.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = A flying fish dings off one of the panels. You're at a loss as to how it got up this high.
