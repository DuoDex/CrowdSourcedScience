		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid, and seems to have a bit of a fishy smell to it.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = A crab decides to wedge itself firmly inside the atmospheric sensor's housing. You end up having to reset the experiment.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = A nosy seagull gets its beak stuck in the atmosphere sensor's housing. You have to reset the experiment.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Sand gets sucked into your instrument and you are unable to get an accurate reading. Oh well, snack time!
		KerbinFlyingHighShores = Atmospheric analysis reports humidity and trace amounts of salt in the air.
		KerbinFlyingHighShores = The scanner registers a faint trace of seaweed and crabs, even way up here.
