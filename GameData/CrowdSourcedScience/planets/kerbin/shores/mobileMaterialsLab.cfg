		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You give the materials lab a wee beach umbrella. 
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Why are you in the lab when you could be at the beach?
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The report seems to be the same as last time. You wish you could be hanging out on the shores right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Your lab report contains thinly-veiled suggestions that the next set of experiments be done at the beach. For science, of course.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = A dastardly seagull has made off with half the samples in the materials lab and left you a foul-smelling present. Damn you seagull, damn you.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The materials seem to have been contaminated by bits of sand and seaweed, but you perform your experiments anyway.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = As you open the materials bay a seagull flies out and poops on your hand. It seems you can never escape the reach of the beach...
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You're pretty happy about the experiment results...but not as happy as you would be if you were on the beach. So how about it, Mission Control?
