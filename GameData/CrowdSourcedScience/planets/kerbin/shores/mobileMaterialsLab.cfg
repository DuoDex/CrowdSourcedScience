		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You give the materials lab a wee beach umbrella. 
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Why are you in the lab when you could be at the beach?
		KerbinFlyingLow = A dastardly seagull has made off with half the samples in the materials lab and left you a foul-smelling present. Damn you seagull, damn you.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The materials seem to have been contaminated by bits of sand and seaweed, but you perform your experiments anyway.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Your lab report contains thinly-veiled suggestions that the next set of experiments be done at the beach. For science, of course.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You sneak long glances out the window as you wait for the experiments to complete.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, didn't we used to have a microwave in this lab?  How are we supposed to get good results when we cant properly heat up our snacks?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You're pretty happy about the experiment results...but not as happy as you would be if you were on the beach. So how about it, Mission Control?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The report seems to be the same as last time.  You wish you could be hanging out on the shores right now.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you open the materials bay a seagull flies out and poops on your hand. It seems you can never escape the reach of the beach...
