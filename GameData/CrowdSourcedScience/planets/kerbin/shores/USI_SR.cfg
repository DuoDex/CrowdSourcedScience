		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Air pressure and temperature are high and stable. Excellent!
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The sea breeze is strong, and that's about all you see before the cardboard dissolves.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Aerial readings just confirm that the weather at the beach is great for sunning yourself in.

		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You're distracted from the window by a beeping from the aeronomy equipment. It's just a blip, and you go back to staring.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Sensitive aeronomy equipment doesn't perform very well when wet and salty. The readings concur.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = The high levels of airborne salt generate tiny static charges, interfering with the experiments.

		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You have established that sand does not make a good material to fabricate things out of.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = It's just water. It doesn't do very much apart from wash several material samples out.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = The wind must have picked up below, since sand is skittering off a few of the test panels. They stand up to it well, though.

		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Some sand ends up in one of the moving parts. By the sounds of it, it really didn't like that.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The salty water is apparently very electrically conductive and corrosive.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Traces of airborne sand and salt begin to collect in the parts, to little effect.
