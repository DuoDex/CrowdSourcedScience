		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You wonder if there's a setting on the thermometer that allows it to warn you of sand-sharks.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to go for a swim in the sea right over there.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The water here is warmer than in the open ocean, perhaps because there's less of it for the Sun to warm up.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Just the right temperature to be a lucrative shark mating area.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Yep, the ambient temperature is the definition of "beach weather".
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = The thermometer reads a balmy 'medium-hot'. Yep, another beautiful day at the shores. Too bad you're stuck in this rocket.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = The temperature seems just about perfect here. You consider doing an EVA without your spacesuit.
