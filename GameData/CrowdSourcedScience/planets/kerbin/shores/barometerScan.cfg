		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The barometric pressure here is high, but you are more interested in sneaking a glance at the bathing suits on the beach.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You send the barometer data back to KSC and reminisce about the good times you have had on these same beaches.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The barometer's dial moves left and right as you watch the surf batter the shores.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Data from the barometer seems to indicate a storm within the next few hours. You wonder if you'll get to see a shipwreck. You hope it's not yours.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Drops of saltwater seem to have encrusted the barometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading. You make something up randomly, and send it back to KSC.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = As you write down the air pressure data you are briefly reminded of your elementary science lessons about 'The Water Cycle'.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = High above the shore you scribble yet another note on the barometric pressure, thinking about all the Kerbals sunning themselves below.
