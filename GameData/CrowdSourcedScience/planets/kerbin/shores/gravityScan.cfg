		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The graviolis throw themselves a beach party. You're not invited.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You are distracted by all the swimsuit-clad Kerbals around you, but manage to take a reading of the local gravity and sign a few autographs as well.
		KerbinInSpaceHighShores = The gravitational signature changes rather significantly as you pass over the shores and over the ocean.
		KerbinInSpaceHighShores = The gravity seems pretty normal here, though you can tell the graviolis wish they were at the beach.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = As the gravity scan continues, your mind wanders to good memories you have of Kerbin's shores.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The sensor passes over the shores of Kerbin. The readings appear to be nominal.
		//LAST_ENTRY
