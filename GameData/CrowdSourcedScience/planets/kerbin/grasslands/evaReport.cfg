		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you go trudging through the grass you hope you don't step on a cow-patty. The spaceship will stink for the rest of the trip.

		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = You peer down into the murky water. What could be lurking down there?
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Mission Control assures you, "don't panic."
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.

		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The hills and valleys of the grasslands seem even closer looking through a spacesuit visor. You begin to long for home. And snacks. Need more snacks.
