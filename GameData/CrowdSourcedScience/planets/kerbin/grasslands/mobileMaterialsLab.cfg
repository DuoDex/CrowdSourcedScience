		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The materials lab has grass-stains on it now from that landing. So much for returning it to the manufacturer for a refund when we are done.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You crack open window as you write up the lab report and bask in the warm sunlight and soothing breeze.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = A blade of grass flies into the lab and lands right in your experiment, ruining the results. Oh well, we'll just make something up for the folks back at KSC.
		KerbinSrflandedGrasslands = A butterfly flies into your experiment. You spend a distracting amount of time thinking up various non-lethal methods to get rid of it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = As expected, most of the samples sink while others float out. You swear you saw a yellow rubber ducky among them.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = The lab seems peaceful as you go about your study over the grassy plains below.
