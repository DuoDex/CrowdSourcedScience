		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The temperature here is quite pleasant. This would be a nice place to live.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You don't need any fancy measurements to tell you that it's nice outside.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The temperature seems cool and comfortable.  It is probably due to the acres of green grass that stretch to the horizon.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = As you perform temperature scans over the Grasslands, you take care not hit any trees.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = 82. Or is that 28? They never did tell you which side of this thing is up.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Huh, it's pretty darn cold. Hard to believe you were just at the Grasslands.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = And the temperature is: perfect for snacking! So how about a few snacks, and then we'll send this report off to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You wonder if the fact that you're over the Grasslands will affect your temperature readings. Probably not.
