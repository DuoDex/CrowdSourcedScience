		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You look forward to opening the capsule door and smelling the fresh earthy smell of grass. Oh yeah, we have to wear these stupid spacesuits even on Kerbin. Who's great idea was that?
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The crew is embroiled in an argument over whether the grass is in fact greener on the other side.
		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = You're bobbing around in a muddy pond in a field. Surely there's more glamorous places for a kerbonaut to be.

		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = It's very comforting to see this much green below you.
