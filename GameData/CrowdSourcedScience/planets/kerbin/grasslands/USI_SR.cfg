		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = Humidity is a little higher, but other than that everything is pretty average.

		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Aeronomy is far too serious a science to do in such a relaxing place.
		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = There appears to be more magnetism here than usual. This pond is hiding something.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Not an awful lof of aeronomy to do here, but you dutifully measure the effect of humidity on atmospheric conductivity.

		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = Luckily, you had the forethought to waterproof the bay before launch.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = A bird flies into a panel of an experimental material, leaving a perfect imprint. You could sell this stuff!

		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = One of the parts makes a loud crack, which scares off the cow that had until then been munching on it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = The parts come back up caked in foul-smelling mud. You don't want to touch them now.
