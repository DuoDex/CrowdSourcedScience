		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito dive-bombing it. Apparently it's carrying malaria.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = It's not so bad here. You wonder what all the fuss was about.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The Gooey puddle you just stepped in appears to be eating through the material of your spacesuit. Better get back to the ship before the atmosphere outside is the same as inside your spacesuit.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = The sensor records a sulfurous rotten egg smell in the atmosphere.  So this is why they call it the Badlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Atmospheric analysis of the surrounding air makes you very glad that you brought your spacesuit.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Upon examining the sensor's readouts, you firmly decide against cracking open a window.
		KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Analysis of the Badlands' atmosphere makes it difficult to believe that you're still on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Glancing nervously at the sensor's readouts, you sincerely hope that Mission Control doesn't tell you to go lower.
		KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = Ozone, check. Carbon Monoxide, check. Hydro-fluorocarbons, check.  Yep, we're in the Badlands.
