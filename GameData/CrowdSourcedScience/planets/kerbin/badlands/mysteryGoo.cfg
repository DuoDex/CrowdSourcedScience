		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = As the goo churns in its container you are reminded of a horror movie where an amorphous goo devours everything in its path. Hope this experiment ends better than the movie.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You try to decide which terrifies you more: Mystery Goo or the Badlands. You break down and cry instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The Mystery Goo explodes. Badlands landing confirmed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = The Goo is trying its best to not float out of its container. It must really want to stay with the ship.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo doesn't like the Badlands. Surprise, surprise.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = The Mystery Goo becomes depressed as you fly over the Badlands. You want to give it a comforting hug then remember why it's a bad idea.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = The Mystery Goo radiates menace as you pass over the Badlands.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Mystery Goo and Badlands seem like a bad combination to you. Rather than opening a Pandora's box, you forgo the experiment and make up some data to send back to KSC.
		//KerbinInSpaceHigh = Dispersing Mystery Goo in space high above the Badlands is not your idea of a good work safety practice.
