		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = As the goo churns in its container you are reminded of a horror movie where an amorphous goo devours everything in its path.  Hope this experiment ends better than the movie.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You try to decide which terrifies you more: Mystery Goo or the Badlands. You break down and cry instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The Mystery Goo explodes. Badlands landing confirmed.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hear a faint, distorted guitar riff coming from The Goo.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Mystery Goo almost seems...eager. You decide you don't really want to know why.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo doesn't like the Badlands. Surprise, surprise.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* 'Bad, Bad, Leroy Brown. Badder than the...'. Oh yeah, science. The mystery goo remains dark and mysterious.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Mystery Goo becomes depressed as you fly over the Badlands. You want to give it a comforting hug then remember why it's a bad idea. 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo looks particularly dark and brooding here.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Mystery Goo radiates menace as you pass over the Badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Mystery Goo and Badlands seem like a bad combination to you. Rather than opening a Pandora's box, you forego the experiment and make up some data to send back to KSC.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Dispersing Mystery Goo in space high above the Badlands is not your idea of a good work safety practice.
