		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature here appears to fluctuate depending on the time of day.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature is bad, and it's getting worse every minute.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Man the EVA is gonna suck.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = It is HOT! You don't know whether it's the normal ambient temperature here or whether the spacecraft is burning up.  Either way, we should have installed air conditioning.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You pour the remains of your juice pack over the engines in a frantic attempt to keep them from overheating.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Let's see...temperature. Slightly cooler than the fiery pits of hell. Yep, that covers it.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Mission Control declares that they can't distinguish your craft from the background ambient temperature. This is a problem since your engines are currently firing...
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Seriously? You want to know the temperature now? We're in space; who cares!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The hellish climate of the Badlands can't touch you up here!
