		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Your thoughts turn to running back to the capsule and hiding from whatever might live in the Badlands.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You place some snacks on a makeshift altar. You hope that your offering pleases the denizens of the Badlands.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Badlands, Shmadlands. It takes more than a bad name to scare this kerbonaut!
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Mission Control assures you reckless displays of bravery are well-received in the Badlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = As you hang on for dear life, you start to question your career choice. 
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Are you really sure now is a good time?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Can I go back in now? Please?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Uh, why did we think this EVA was a good idea, again?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = More like EXTREME Vehicular Activity, am I right?
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The badlands don't look so bad from up here. YOU HEAR THAT BADLANDS?! YOU DON'T SCARE US!!.....we're not going down there, are we?
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = As you sigh in relief at the distance separating you from the Badlands, you find yourself thankful that there's no such thing as Badspace.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Somehow you get the feeling that something down there is watching you. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Pssht. Badlands. Whatever. Next they're gonna say Eeloo is a giant snowball and Laythe is populated by another race of Kerbals.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = If you squint really hard and press your thumb against the glass, you can almost pretend that the Badlands don't exist!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you gaze at the beautiful blue ball that is your home-world, you wonder who screwed up and made the Badlands.
