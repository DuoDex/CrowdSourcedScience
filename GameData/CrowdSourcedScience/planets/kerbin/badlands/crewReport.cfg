		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You start to feel very nervous about all the bad things you said about the Badlands.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You became a kerbonaut specifically to get away from the Badlands. And now here you are. Congratulations.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You try to have a good time. You fail.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You start to share scary stories about the strange things found in the Badlands, but Mission Control shushes you.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You bet this is where all the cool kids come to land.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You have a bad feeling about this.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Crashing here would not be good.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what is down there on the surface. If only you had some binoculars.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = From this high up, the Badlands doesn't look so bad. You still don't want to crash there though.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Whatever lives in the Badlands can't get you up here. You hope.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = We should have fixed the GPS before taking off so we'd know what biome we're in. Oh well, rocket fuel is expensive.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = From this altitude, you realize that you'll pass over the Badlands several times per hour. This worries you more than it should.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You can see the Badlands from orbit. Ew.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You really are high as a kite, rocket-man. Maybe higher.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You almost have a panic attack as your instrumentation warns that you are directly over the Badlands. Then you laugh as you remember that you're over a quarter million kilometers away.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You have mixed feelings about being this far away from Kerbin. On the one hand you're pretty far from home, but on the other hand you're pretty far from the Badlands.
