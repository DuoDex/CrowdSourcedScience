		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor looks like it went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You transmit the readings. Mission Control immediately calls you back and demands to know if you are still on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You think that the barometer is broken but you're too scared to go outside and fix it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = The water really doesn't help the havoc the Badlands plays on the instrumentation.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = You don't bother to look at the display. The fact that you're in the Badlands tells you all you need to know.
