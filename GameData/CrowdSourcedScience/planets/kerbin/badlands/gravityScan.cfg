		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The gravity here is just...gravity. The scientists said it would somehow be 'bad' gravity. Wish we were paid like them for being wrong, rather than exploding in a giant crashing fireball.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Yep, looks like the same gravity you find anywhere else on Kerbin. Seems that gravity isn't too impressed by the so-called 'Badlands'.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Gravity doesn't care that you're in the Badlands. Gravity knows how to treat everything right.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = *singing* 'Get low, get low, get low, get low'. Oh yeah, gravity. Yeah, we got that.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The gravitational data is completely nominal, something you didn't expect passing over a place called the 'Badlands'.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Turns out Badlands gravity is just like regular gravity. Who knew?
		KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = The sensor gives a very negative readout as you pass over the badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = You somehow get the feeling that the gravitational sensor disapproves of what it's seeing.
		KerbinInSpaceHighBadlands = The gravity scanner seems surlier than usual.
