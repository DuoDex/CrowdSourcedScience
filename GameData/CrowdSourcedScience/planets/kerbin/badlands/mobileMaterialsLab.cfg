		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry what it will do to them.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Turns out the Badlands is a bad place for a materials lab. Who knew?
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Some of your samples are starting to give you attitude. You're pretty sure this a bad sign.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The lab is in complete disarray after hitting turbulence over the Badlands.
		KerbinFlyingLow = As you fly over the Badlands, you hear evil laughter and what sounds like thunder coming from inside the lab.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You resist the urge to cackle madly and speak in a German accent as you pass over the Badlands.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You are flying high over the Badlands, so naturally your thoughts turn to recreational substances.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = As you expose the samples to the Badlands' atmosphere, you force yourself to accept the fact that they will never be the same again.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Even at this altitude, none of your samples are spared from the horror that is the Badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You quickly slam the door shut on the lab after peeking in.  It doesn't look good in there, to say the least.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples don't appear to be bothered too much by the fact that they're over the Badlands. Perhaps its influence is limited to within the atmosphere?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples barely react other than giving a small shudder.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You consider how nice it is to be in the lab rather than in the Badlands below you.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The materials bay seems cautiously optimistic about being this far away from the Badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = This far out, the Badlands have little to no noticeable affect on your array of samples.
