		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It is so hot here that your feet are burning even through the spacesuit.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You pour your juice onto a small cactus. You decide to call it Mr. Prick and hope it grows up to be a beautiful palm tree. That's how it works, right?
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You can see the cactus and scrub brush clearly from here.  Too clearly for comfort.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The air is dusty and dry. Each breath leaves you wanting.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Great swaths of brown and tan stretch out before you. You wonder how anything can live in such a dry environment.  Including you as you hurtle through the atmosphere.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You begin to have an appreciation for the saying 'as right as rain'.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = You look down and contemplate the desert below.  Then you contemplate having a snack when you return to the ship, because really, snacks are far more interesting than a dusty desert.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Just looking down is making you thirsty.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You contemplate the serene beauty of Kerbin's deserts, and long for solid ground.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Memories of Kerbin's deserts keep you warm as you work in the cold depths of outer space.
