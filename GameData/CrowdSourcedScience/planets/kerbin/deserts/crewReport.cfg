		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You imagine how hot it would be if the capsule did not have the a/c on.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Is that an oasis?
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You are so very thirsty.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The crew complains about the heat.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look out the window hoping to find a tasty cake until you realize somebody made a slight spelling error in the flight plan.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look around and see no water for miles. You begin to wonder why you didn't bring more.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You wonder if crashing here would create a glass crater. Then you realize how cool that would be.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = In anticipation of the heat, you turn on the air conditioning.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Is that the desert down there? It looks awful dry and sandy.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Wow that desert is big. You squint your eyes and try to count the palm trees.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You never get tired of the view from space, even flying over this part of the planet.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = If you were in charge of creating Kerbin you wouldn't have wasted so much space on an empty desert. They could at least give it a swimming pool or something.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You can't see any plant life below, and can't decide whether it's because you are too far away, or that nothing grows here.	
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = From up here, the desert and the oceans look like one giant beach! Beaches are fun!
