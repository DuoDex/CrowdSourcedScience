		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This can't be right, the sensor is detecting the atmosphere as solid! Oh wait, it's just dust-clogged again.  
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much drier over the desert.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Very little signs of precipitation. No wonder the place looks so thirsty.
		KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = The sensor reads 0 humidity.  In fact it looks like the needle is bent as the gauge tries to register negative numbers.
		KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = The humidity readings make you want to take off your spacesuit and lather yourself in lotion.
