		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Watching the dust swirl among the samples, you realize that you're going to have to spend a lot of time cleaning them up for the next mission.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You take your juice pack and pour it all over the samples to prepare them for the dry, dusty ordeal they are about to face. Mission Control sighs and tells you to use a different set of samples.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Several of the samples expand from soaking up water. The cactus looks particuarly pleased.
		//KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the doors of the material bay, you see tiny dust particles from the deserts of Kerbin float free. You wonder where they will eventually end up and hope the answer isn't 'in your sock'. 
		//LAST_ENTRY
