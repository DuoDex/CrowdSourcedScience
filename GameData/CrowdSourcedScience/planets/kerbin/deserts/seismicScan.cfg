		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = *singing* "I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it feels good to be out of the rain". Oops! As you were singing you drop the accelerometer into one of the cracks in the dry ground, and can't reach it.  Oh well, time to make something up for the scientists back at KSC again.
