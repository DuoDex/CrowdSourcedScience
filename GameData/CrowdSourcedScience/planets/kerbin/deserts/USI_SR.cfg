		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Humidity is low, and the wind is picking up. You hope there's no sandstorm later.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = It's still not raining here, but at least there's some water.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = It's still just as hot and dry off the ground. And dusty.

		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The dust in the atmosphere obscures much of the upper atmosphere phenomena from the ground.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Especially sensitive aeronautical instruments do not react well to water, even desert water.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The dust particles thick in the air generates a large static charge as they rub against the vessel.

		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Several substances crack from drying out and the high levels of heat.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = You're more concerned about the materials the materials box is made of, which is currently wet and sagging alarmingly.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Persistent sandblasting has taken its toll on several of the experimental hull plates' paint.

		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = A cascade of sand falls out of the box. You don't need to look inside to tell what's happened to them.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = You weren't expecting to encounter water in the driest places on Kerbin, so nothing was waterproofed.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Airborne dust is even worse than surface sand for getting into everything, including delicate components.
