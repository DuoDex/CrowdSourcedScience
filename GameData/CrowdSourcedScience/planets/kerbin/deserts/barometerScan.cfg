		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Barometer reads very high. No rain in sight. In fact you wonder if it has EVER rained here.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's not going to rain for a long time.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Readings here are the same as usual: high. Nothing else to report.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDeserts = Looks like there won't be rain for a long time. You wonder how this water got here.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = You wonder what a desert storm would look like.
		//KerbinFlyingLow = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
		//KerbinFlyingHigh = The display gives very little indication that you're flying over a desert.
