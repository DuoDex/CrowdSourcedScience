		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You look around at some dried bones scattered on the ground, and feel the tug of Kerbin's gravitational field pulling you to the earth.  Or maybe that is just your imagination.  Time for some snacks! 
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You splash juice over the gravity scanner. It was probably pretty thirsty.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = The dunes appear to have a stable gravity, though some spikes indicate the underground terrain varies in composition.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Gravitational data from orbit reveals an incredibly complex network of subterranean formations beneath the deserts of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceHighDeserts = Orbital gravity scans make the deserts far more interesting than they appear to be to the naked eye.
		KerbinInSpaceHighDeserts = The graviolis here seem dry and dusty like the surface below.  You consider offering them a glass of water, but have no idea how to speak gravioli.
