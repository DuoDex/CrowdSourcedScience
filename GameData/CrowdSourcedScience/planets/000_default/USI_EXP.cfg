		default = You try to take a selfie, but the guys back at KSC yell at you.
		default = Mission Control tells you to move your big fat thumb out of the way.
		default = You don't understand why Mission Control is so interested in looking at rocks. Surely a heroic and intrepid explorer such as yourself would make a far better subject.
		default = You smile and wave at the camera and hope that your family is watching.
		default = You make sure that all your shots include at least a little bit of lens flare.
