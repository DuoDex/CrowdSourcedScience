		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = You step onto the ice and immediately almost slip over. Some things never change about ice.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Thankfully, the suits have climate control. You try and stop yourself thinking about you freezing your ass off without it.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = From the air, you can clearly see the shape of the icy depression. Quite a large hole indeed.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = The hope you had of being able to have a snowball fight fade as you see it's all ice.
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = It's white, and it looks cold down there. If you're going down there, you should probably go and search for some warm gloves.
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = The crater appears as a dark dot set against the slightly pinkish whiteness of the polar ice cap.
