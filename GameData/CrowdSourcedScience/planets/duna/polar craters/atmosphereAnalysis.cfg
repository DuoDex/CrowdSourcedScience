		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Lots of airborne ices-analysis reports they consist of varying ratios of hydroxic acid and carbonic anhydride. Sounds scary.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = The wind picks up, and a cloud of water and carbon dioxide ice crystals fills the air.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarCraters = The inlet on the analyser develops a layer of frost in the lower regions of the upper atmosphere. Curous, considering it didn't have any water on it.
