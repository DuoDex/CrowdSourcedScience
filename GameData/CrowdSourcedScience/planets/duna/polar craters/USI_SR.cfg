		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Strong, freezing winds spiral into the crater by night, and back out by day.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = You're still picking up evidence of the crater microclimate. It must be pretty strong to extend this far up.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Diurnal air pressure fluctuations are especially pronounced here thanks to the local topography.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = An odd spike in solar radiation is detected even through the greater degree of atmospheric protection at these high latitudes.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarCraters = Air currents in this zone of the atmosphere are sluggish and sinking.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = These are some of the harshest conditions on Duna, with strong winds and extreme cold. Few of the test materials survive.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = Ice collects on the samples box, with that and aero forces threatening to snap it off in its brittle state.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarCraters = At this altitude, it's just like space, except slightly warmer. It's arguably a less hostile environment for materials than space around Duna.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The most useful part down here would be a heater. You're not sure why they want to test stuff like oxygen tanks and hull panels.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = A few of the more fragile moving parts stop functioning after icing up, which is odd as there's very little atmospheric water.
