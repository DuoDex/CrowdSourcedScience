		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = While the detector does its thing, you distract yourself with a view of the pretty white landscape.
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = The size of the blip created by the depression is too large for the ice alone, the crater must extend into the rock deep below.
		DunaInSpaceHighPolarCraters = From up here you can get a gravimetric image of the whole area, with the crater clearly visible as an area of lower gravity.
