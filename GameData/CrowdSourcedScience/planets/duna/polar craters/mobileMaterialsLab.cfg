		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Ice cascades off the sample bay doors as they open, and it's more interesting than what happens to the samples (they get cold, and that's it).
		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = Following exposure, most of the liquid samples freeze while a few boil instead. The solid ones do very little.
