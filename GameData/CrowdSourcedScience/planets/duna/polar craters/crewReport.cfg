		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = You look out at the vast icy bowl in the landscape and dearly hope the EVA suits are climate controlled.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The cabin radiator clicks on, dispelling the cold seeping into the craft.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = All you can see is pinkish ice to the horizon, albeit lacking the dust haze of the lower latitudes.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarCraters = You fumble around the glovebox for a pair of sunglasses to protect from the ice glare, which is strong even in the weak Dunaian sun.
