		//DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
		//DunaFlyingLow = It's cold enough as it is, and the wind chill from flying through the air makes it even colder.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Turning up the thermostat in your climate controlled suit does little to keep the cold from creeping into your toes.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Duna is cold, so thermal back radiation at night is limited. It's definitely there, though.
		DunaInSpaceLow = You hope the atmosphere provides a bit more insulation at the surface than you get in space.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = As expected, it's cold at Duna's distance from Kerbol. By extension, Duna is cold as well.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The gauge on the thermometer sticks, so you give it a few taps. It drops another few degrees.
