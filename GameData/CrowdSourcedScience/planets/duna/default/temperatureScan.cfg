		DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
		DunaFlyingLow = It's cold enough as it is, and the wind chill from flying through the air makes it even colder.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Turning up the thermostat in your climate controlled suit does little to keep the cold from creeping into your toes.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The surface below glints white and is covered in craters. The temperature is a comfortable 5 degrees above absolute zero.
