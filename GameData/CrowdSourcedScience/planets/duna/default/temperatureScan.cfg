		DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck.
		DunaFlyingLow = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise a kid. Matter of fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
