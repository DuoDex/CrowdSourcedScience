		DunaFlyingHigh = Luckily the Dunaian atmosphere is very thin. Otherwise you and your craft would get separated very quickly pulling a stunt like this.		
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's low gravity would lend itself well to an exciting game of basketball! You consider adding a hoop to your next lander design.
		DunaSrfLanded = You see red. A LOT of red.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air is a little thin up here. Down here?
		DunaSrfLanded = A gust of wind creates a small red dust storm, it's hard to see.
