		//DunaSrfLanded = Your science report text here.
		//DunaFlyingLow = Your science report text here.
		//DunaFlyingHigh = Your science report text here.
		
		//DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads: "Gasping for air". You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.
		//DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		//DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it's still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
		//DunaSrfLanded = There isn't much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
		DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingLow = Not much pressure, and even less when flying at altitude.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Even the barometer isn't sure how to interpret the readings.
		DunaFlyingHigh = There's some gas up here, but not much. What little pressure there is remains far below.
		DunaInSpaceLow = You're pretty sure this is a vacuum, but given how thin the atmosphere is you can't really be sure.
		DunaInSpaceLow = You're the one under pressure here, not the barometer. It quite clearly shows.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The surface all the way down there must surely have more atmosphere than up here.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = There's probably a few atoms out there, but you can't detect them with a simple barometer.
