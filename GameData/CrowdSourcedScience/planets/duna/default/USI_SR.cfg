		DunaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere up here is extremely cold, and the temperature changes quickly with sundown and sunrise.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Weak atmospheric cells carry appreciable quantities of dust high into the atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature of the surrounding atmosphere warms slightly near its edge, suggesting the presence of a thermosphere.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Atmospheric pressure is still nothing here, obviously with no measurable weather. At least you know there's no atmosphere here, right?
		DunaInSpaceLow = The sensor registers the very tiniest amounts of residual atmosphere here, but no weather.
		DunaInSpaceLow = There's not very much atmosphere at the surface, and there's even less here. Zero, to be precise.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The datalogger gets bored with recording nothing and goes into sleep mode.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You wish the sensor measured space weather so you could justify bringing it to space.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The sensor records the presence of snow in space. Or it could just be the result of spacecraft steam venting and snap-freezing.

		DunaFlyingHigh = Large amounts of charged particles and excited gas suggest a powerful aurora took place here recently. How is a mystery.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The solar wind appears to be blowing a stream of gas off into space from the upper atmosphere. Could this be how Duna lost its atmosphere?
		DunaFlyingHigh = A spike in pressure and turbulence is recorded as you fly through one of Duna's high-altiutude jet streams.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Cosmic radiation is much higher at this altitude than on Kerbin, but atmospheric mixing means there is no spike in cosmogenic nuclides.
		DunaInSpaceLow = There's no atmosphere here, but you run the experiment anyway. Y'know, to tick it off the list.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Fed up with getting nothing, you blast the detector with some gas from a vent and note the results down for a joke.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Faint magnetic field distorions channelling trace gases are registered emanating from an indeterminate area of the surface.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Just because you brought it to Duna doesn't mean it'll detect an atmosphere in space.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You're pretty sure the detector is malfunctioning. There isn't 2,745,948Pa of pressure up here. Or any, for that fact.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You idly scan the magnetosphere with the sensor's detectors. There are a few isolated relic fields in the Southern Basin, but nothing substantial remains.

		DunaFlyingHigh = Some of the samples begin to exhibit signs of corrosion, which is strange in an oxygen-poor atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingHigh = As you streak through the dust-laden atmosphere, a few of the weaker materials are shredded by aero forces.
		DunaFlyingHigh = You forget to actually record the effects on the materials, as you're too busy searching for the parachute button.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Last you checked, this was still a standard vacuum. Yep, it's still a vacuum.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The planetshine reflected by Duna seems to be of too long a wavelength to allow for effective collection by the experimental photovoltaic cells.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The thin layer of frost that formed on the materials at launch appears to still be there, blocking observations.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You discover you need a lot less material for radiation shielding here at Duna, but more for insulation.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Nothing much has happened to the test materials, still floating normally about in the zero-G environment.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The Blutonium-238 sample is glowing the same colour as Duna. Wait, WHAT? Put it back!

		DunaFlyingHigh = The trace atmosphere up here means these components won't need to be designed with atmospheric entry G-forces in mind.
		DunaFlyingHigh = the Dunaian atmosphere is extremely cold in its upper reaches, necessitating extra insulation for parts.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The low-level ion trail created by atmospheric entry is too weak to affect the array of test aerials' transmissions.
		DunaInSpaceLow = You could write up a report, but all that matters is the data says the snack oven will still work out here.
		DunaInSpaceLow = A micrometeoroid dings off one of the parts and knocks it spinning out of the bay with a big dent in the side.
		DunaInSpaceLow = What's this? The test aerial seems to be experiencing a repeating and very annoying interference pattern whenever you pass over a particular spot. You thump it, to no avail.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's lack of an appreciable magnetic field means no radiation belts, which means no radiation damage.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Experimental solar cells are recording under half of Kerbin equivalent power generation.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The test results here perfectly mimic the results from Kerbin space. Why did we have to come here for this?
