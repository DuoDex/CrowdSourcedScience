		//DunaSrfLanded = The samples appear to be permanently red. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		//DunaSrfLanded = The samples are slowly turning red. Or is that just your eyesight?
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere whips most of the samples of the bay immediately. Seems you underestimated it.
		DunaFlyingLow = There's a fizzling sound as the dust shorts something out in the bay mechanism. It comes back online after a few shakes and presses.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Some of the lighter samples still shift around in the rushing high-altitude air.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The upper atmosphere is too rarefied and thin to react with anything other than pushing stuff about.
		DunaInSpaceLow = A thruster jolt must have disturbed one of the samples, since it's currently all over the wall.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The samples haven't done much in space, but what they do on the surface must be very interesting.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The radiation on the journey here has bleached some of the samples, and polymers have turned brittle.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Normal spacey stuff has happened to the samples. Yes, that's what we call it.
