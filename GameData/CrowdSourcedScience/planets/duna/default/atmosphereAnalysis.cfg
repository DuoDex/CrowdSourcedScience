		DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
		DunaSrfLanded = 255. Definitely 255.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
