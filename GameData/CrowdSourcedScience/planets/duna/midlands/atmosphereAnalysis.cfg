		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer says the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = After getting some strange readings, you open up the analysis chamber to check the instruments. A large amount of dust pours out onto the ground.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The analyser develops a caking of dust, so you jolt the craft from side to side to shake it off.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlands = The concentrations of argon, nitrogen and other trace gases are significantly higher than the surface up here.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlands = The relative absence of dust up here allows for largely uninterrupted atmospheric sampling.
