		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = A small gust of wind blows on the ship. The sensor thinks it's a hurricane.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = This is an excellent place to get data on Duna's wider atmosphere as a wholly average location.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = You left the heater on, and as you watch the outer oxide layer on the 'stainless' steel reacts with the dust and falls away to reveal the shiny metal underneath.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = It's cold. As you dutifully make your observations, you wonder if reinforced ice would be a viable building material here.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Compasses don't seem to work here in the absense of a worldwide magnetic field and ferrous minerals in the dust. Let's hope nobody tries to go exploring.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The test components are largely resistant to the harsh Dunaian conditions. That's good, because your ship is made of them.
