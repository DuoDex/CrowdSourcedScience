		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The sensor refuses to work, citing 'FOREIGN CONTAMINANT'. You sigh, knowing you have to clean it out again.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Seems pretty normal aside from Ike's libration causing slight tides.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = The gravimeter reading dips ever so slightly whenever you pass over one of the snaking valleys.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = No anomalies here, just the perfect region for Dunaian interior mapping.
		DunaInSpaceHighMidlands = The Midlands' signal is drowned out by gravimetric noise from the surrounding highlands and canyons.
		DunaInSpaceHighMidlands = Even safely out of its reach, Ike still manages to be annoying and mess with your readings.
