		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = Very small piles of fine grain red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = You write down 'red', 'bouldered', and 'dusty' in the logbook.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The low red hills start to blend into one another in the distance. You rub your eyes.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlands = The planet looks very red, which reminds you of the red chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?
