		DunaSrfLandedCraters = The surface here is much more solid, darker and less crumbly that other areas on Duna, indicating different localised geology.
		DunaSrfLandedCraters = The minerals you manage to chip off the rocks on the crater floor display oddly deformed crystal structures, as though subjected to intense heat and pressure.
		DunaSrfLandedCraters = You pick around, searching for a piece of the ancient meteorite that hit here. Instead, you find a piece of your ship hull that you can't quite seem to find where it came from.
