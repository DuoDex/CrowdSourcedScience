		DunaSrfLandedCraters = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
		DunaSrfLandedCraters = The natural bowl in the landscape means the sensor reads higher than average dust concentrations.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = You get distracted by staring at the crater and miss the readings, so you just note down '100% dust'.
		DunaFlyingHighCraters = Looks pretty normal from up here. Ground topography doesn't seem to affect the upper atmosphere much.
		DunaFlyingHighCraters = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
