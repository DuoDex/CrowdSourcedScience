		DunaSrfLandedCraters = Surface measurements of the gravitational anomaly that exists here allow precise measuring of its effect on Duna's internal structure.
		DunaSrfLandedCraters = While you wait for the gravimeter to finish its scanning, a rock rolls downhill and bounces off the window with a crack to remind you you're on a slope.
		DunaInSpaceLowCraters = Gravitational field strength dips noticeably as you pass over the crater. Surface measurements would let us nail down evem more detailed readings.
		DunaInSpaceLowCraters = You don't see the normal crustal shock signatures found at Kerbin's own crater, suggesting Duna has a different internal structure.
		DunaInSpaceHighCraters = Readings point teasingly at the presence of a gravimetric anomaly, but you can't isolate it at this altitude.
		DunaInSpaceHighCraters = You're eating a snack when the display suddenly gives its loud 'anomaly bleep'. You give the console a smack for its trouble.
