		DunaSrfLandedCraters = You've proven the alien conspiracy theorists wrong. There are no tall, pink men anywhere to be seen.
		DunaSrfLandedCraters = You can't see the edges of the crater from the ground. Are you sure this is even a crater?
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = OK, from up here you can see the edges of this vast bowl in the landscape. You feel small.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = Even down here the thin Dunaian atmosphere is too tenuous to slow you down much.
		DunaInSpaceLowCraters = Even from here you can see the outline of the craters. You feel glad Kerbin only has one of these great holes.
		DunaInSpaceLowCraters = You try to get a good look, but a glint of sunlight off the ice caps has you attempting to rub your eyes through your visor.
