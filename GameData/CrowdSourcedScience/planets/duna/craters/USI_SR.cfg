		DunaSrfLandedCraters = The landscape bowl around here creates its own microclimate as the thin air sinks to the bottom.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = There's surprising little evidence of topographical influence on weather up here. Must be a very low-level phenomenon.

		DunaSrfLandedCraters = Not much difference from elsewhere on Duna, if a little colder. Not that the materials really seem to care.

		DunaSrfLandedCraters = Solar panel production logs show the crater walls block out more sunlight than elsewhere at dawn and dusk.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = Above the interference caused by the iron-bearing dust, the compass shows the presence of an extremely weak and deformed magnetic field around the crater-a relic of the impact, perhaps?
