		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = The fine dust here means the analyser actually records the atmospheric composition for once without being filled with sand...let's see...lots of C02, some Ar and N2...and not much else.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = Faint traces of ice crystals are detected, perhaps being carried into the canyon by the Northern Shelf winds?
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon = Now, the one time dust isn't an issue, the analyser blows a fuse and stops working anyway. Poxy thing
		//LAST_ENTRY
