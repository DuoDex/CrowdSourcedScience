		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Looks like standard crustal patterns here. Whatever made this canyon wasn't anything tectonic.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = No major variations are detected, aside from a tiny drop in overall gravity as you pass over the valley.
		DunaInSpaceHighMidlandCanyon = Ike's influence is especially strong here (it's right overhead), making it very hard to conduct precise measurements of the ground.
