		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = On one side you can see rock face, on the other you can see the vast expanse of the Midland Sea.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = You look up at the walls, but lose your balance and tip over, landing on your back in the dust.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = The sun is shining, but it's still cold here. Cold enough to make you wish you had brought some hot koffee with you.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = You're in the air but thanks to the looming walls, you don't feel like you're getting any higher.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = You trace the outline of the canyon in front of you. It reminds you of a koffee stain.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = It looks like someone had their koffee cup on the surface or tried to saw through the crust. Either way, it's impressive.
