		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Air cascades down the canyon walls and into the flatlands to the south at nights, and the east-west winds dominate during the day.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = Mid-altitude winds are slightly stronger up here, possibly due to the equatorial latitudes.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon = The cellular-associated winds blowing north are weak and variable in this section of the upper atmosphere.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = Pressure shows a bump after sundown, but appears to remain quite steady throughout the rest of the night and day.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = There's no discernable effect created by the canyon walls on the air patterns around here, meaning currents must be weak.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon = A few faint traces of plasma are detected, presumably related to that meteor you saw streak past earlier.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = It's cold, and the dust just makes the conditions even more degrading to materials.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = Dust graint hiss off the metallic materials, generating a tiny static charge in them.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon = It's basically a vacuum up here, in which case cosmic radiation and micrometeoroids would prove a much greater challenge to the materials scientists.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandCanyon = You open up a new 'dustproof' box, and sand cascades out. You could swear it's magically teleporting into things now, just to troll you.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandCanyon = Airborne dust particulates here looks to be small enough to pass through several of the air filters you brought, necessitating finer ones.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandCanyon = Aero forces are negligible at this altitude, and the atmosphere is too thin to pose much of a threat to parts through shock heating.
