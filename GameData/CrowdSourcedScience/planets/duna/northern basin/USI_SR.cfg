		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Gentle westerly winds flow around the central rebound peak and up from the Western Canyon, even through the disruption causd by temerature swings after dawn and dusk.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The airstreams flowing up and over the cental peak contain much finer dust than on the ground.

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Pressure rises and falls around dusk and dawn, though much less than would be expected for a basin this size.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = A distant dust storm lets loose a bolt of lightning. You wish you were measuring that instead of this mundane stuff.

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Limited pressure swings make this environment less harsh on the materials, but still hostile enough to render the metals brittle.

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = While the temperature and pressure don't vary as much as elsewhere, many of the glass parts still crack from the repeated thermal stress.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The dust low to the surface is coarse enough to qualify as sand, but higher up it becomes fine enough once again to ruin electronics.
