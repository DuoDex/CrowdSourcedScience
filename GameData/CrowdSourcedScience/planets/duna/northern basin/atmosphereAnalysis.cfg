		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The dust is quite coarse here, and the gas mixtures are fairly Duna-standard.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The dust seems to stay low to the ground here, as there's not much off it off the ground.
		DunaFlyingHighNorthernBasin = You have to crank the sensitivity on the detector all the way up to get any readings in the extra-thin air.
