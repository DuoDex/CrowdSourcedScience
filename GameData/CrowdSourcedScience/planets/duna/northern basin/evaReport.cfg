		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = You can't see the other side of the basin. Whatever sort of basin it is, it's massive!
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = Your suit does a pretty good job of keeping you warm in the cold, but your toes are getting a bit chilly.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The wind tries its best to buffet you around, but you manage to stay steady and get a look around from a slightly higher vantage point.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernBasin = The wind blowing around you is cold. Like, really cold. You long for the warmth of your seat on the ship.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = From here, you can see the basin, with the huge rebound peak in the centre giving it away as a crater. It's enormous!
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The huge basin below looks like a doughnut, to compliment the koffee stain canyon to the east.
