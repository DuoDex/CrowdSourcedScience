		DunaSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The detector doesn't pick up much out of the ordinary.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = Overall gravity strength forms a W-shaped graph thanks to the presence of the rebound peak.
		DunaInSpaceHighNorthernBasin = Not much. There are two small dips from passing over the basin, maybe a lower-altitude observation will reveal more?
