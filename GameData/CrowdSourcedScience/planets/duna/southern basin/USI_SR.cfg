		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ice cap has a large influence on the climate here, with katabatic winds that reverse every day.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = The sensor records data on how the winds from the dusty and icy zones mix.
		DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin = Same old air currents up here. The transition from rock to ice doesn't seem to have any effect this far up.

		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The dusty ice gets into the sensor and melts, soaking the electronics.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = Nothing much new is happening here aeronomy-wise. Sure, it's cold, but what don't we know?
		DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin = The air is so thin up here, the sensor is barely able to collect data. The atmosphere turns out to be thinner than expected at this altitude.

		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The cold temperatures, dust and ice and moderate winds take their toll on the materials, but none actually fail.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = Dust in the ice lowers its melting point, it seems. Not sure how useful that is, but it's interesting.
		DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin = You open up the materials box to have a look, and it seems someone put some Goo in there (probably for a laugh). You shut the door again quite quickly.

		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Who cares about what we're supposed to do? This slush is more exciting, as Duna dust could be used as a de-icer...if you can bring it back.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = The mixture of ice and dust flying around also seems to be conductive, since several of the exposed components short out.
		DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin = You might as well be testing these things under vacuum conditions, since the atmosphere is so thin and cold up here.
