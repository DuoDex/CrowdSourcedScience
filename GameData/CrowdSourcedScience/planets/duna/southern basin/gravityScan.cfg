		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ice cap in the south distorts the gravity here slightly, and the basin itself shows the signatures of volcanic activity.
		DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = Not too exciting. There's a tiny dip in overall strength, the Kouguer wave shows a bump as if the crust was thinner here.
		DunaInSpaceHighSouthernBasin = Getting a lot of interference from the ice caps and Ike, but there looks to be some small anomalies.
