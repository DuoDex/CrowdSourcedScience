		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = There's a lot of frozen water in this basin, hidden under a thin layer of dust.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = There's a lighter section among the basalt. It looks a bit like limestone. You consider it important and put some of it into your sample container.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Nearby rocks look consistent with flood basalts on Kerbin, suggesting this area was once a giant volcano.
