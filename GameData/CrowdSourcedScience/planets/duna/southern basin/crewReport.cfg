		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ice is slowly creeping over the ancient lava field. You hope it doesn't creep over you, too.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = One side of the basin is mostly ice, the other is mostly rock. You check the map to see which side you landed on.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = A sudden gust of freezing wind almost blows the ship off course. Such are the hazards of being near the icy zones.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = You want to do a barrel roll, until you realise KSC is closely monitoring all craft telemetry and you'd rather keep your job when you return.
