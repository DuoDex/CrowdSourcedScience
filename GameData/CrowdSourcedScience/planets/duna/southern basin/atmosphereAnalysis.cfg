		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = Here the dust of the lowlands mixes with ice crystals blowing off the ice caps, creating reddish snow.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = The ice crystals appear to stay closer to the ground, up in the air it's mostly dust. And C02. And N2. And Ar.
		DunaFlyingHighSouthernBasin = Climate cells and northerly air currents ensure no ice is detected up here.
