		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = The ground is slushy underfoot, as though it can't make its mind up over whether it wants to be ice or rock.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthernBasin = A squall of freezing wind blows off the ice cap, briefly making you very cold indeed.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = You distract yourself from the effects of the rushing cold air by imagining sitting back in the Astronaut Complex breakroom with a cup of warm koffee and a biscuit.
		DunaFlyingLowSouthernBasin = It's even colder than usual up here at these high latitudes, and the wind chill from flying makes it even colder. You hope the airheads at the AC fixed your suit heater before you left.
		DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = It's easy to track the edges of the basin on the land, but where it disappears under the ice it's hard to make them out.
		DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = The depression is just about visible running under the ice as a darkened patch of lower elevation
