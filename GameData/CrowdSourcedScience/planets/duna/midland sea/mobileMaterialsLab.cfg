		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You put a small sample of subsurface sand into the chamber, and hear a series of tiny pops from the sodium as you heat it. Interesting.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You lost a few of the test samples in transit, but that's not really an issue as they all just turn red anyway.
