		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The net gravity strength here varies ever so slightly with Ike's libration pattern.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = All the while the sensor is running, you find yourself hoping aloud that the sand stays out of it. The warranty was voided long ago, and gravimeters are expensive!
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = A dip as the elevation drops, and a bump as it rises. Nothing special, really.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = Readings spew from the device onto the monitor as a wavy line, but not really that wavy.
		DunaInSpaceHighMidlandSea = You bash the monitor, as the line isn't moving. It still doesn't move.
		DunaInSpaceHighMidlandSea = The readings slowly collate into a gravimetric map of... one single colour, with a dip thanks to Ike in the middle.
