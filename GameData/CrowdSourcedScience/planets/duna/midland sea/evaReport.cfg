		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You look up at Ike overhead, and it reminds you of Dres. It's just as dull, too.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You trudge on through the fine red sand, dust cascading off your boots with every step.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Airborne sand grains skitter off your visor glass, creating an almost hypnotic hissing noise.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Despite moving at some speed through the air, you don't feel any kind of substantial wind resistance. The atmosphere must be extremely thin.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = You look down, and try to imagine the Midland Sea when it was still full of water. It's hard, given the state of the place now.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = The surface in the depression looks darker and the edges are clearly visible, especially in the great semicircular scar in the north.
