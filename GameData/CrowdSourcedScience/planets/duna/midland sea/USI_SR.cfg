		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = Surface air currents here are quite universal-a steady westwards breeze.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Fine airborne dust fills the air once off the ground, and drops slower with altitude than other places.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = High concentrations of dust extend high into the atmosphere, as though drawn skywards by a major air current system.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = Tiny electrical charges build up and dissipate along with the feeble wind.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = You observe tiny pressure variations oscillating along with Ike's libration patterns.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = Air currents at this altitude are muddled and variable, with no one direction dominating. Ike's atmospheric tide effects sweep back and forth through the upper atmosphere.

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = No material seems to be immune to being turned red on exposure to the Dunaian dust-looks like pink spacesuits are here to stay.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = Exposure to cold, wind and dust has made some of the metals measurably more brittle.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = You expected to be able to run dust-related tests up here given the air currents, but there strangely doesn't seem to be enough dust for once. What are you supposed to test with now?

		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = Bzzt. One of the components shorts out, though upon close inspection you can't find any trace of dust. Curious.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = You reach for the button to expose the components, and instead hit the button to release them all. You whistle innocently as you fudge some results.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = Test data from the craft itself informs you that the speed of sound is much lower here, rendering ailerons less useful at higher speeds. Not that they really were to begin with.
