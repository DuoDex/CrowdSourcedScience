		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The sensor beeps, clicks and whirrs as it works. You wish you had a protocol droid handy so you could tell what it was saying to itself.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You put a small crystal from the subsurface ice into the analyser to see what would happen. It melts, and after more heating the analyser reports its vapour contains much more deuterium than Kerbin's.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = The inlet valve for the air has frozen shut yet again, reminding you that it's still freezing outside.
		DunaFlyingLowMidlandSea = C02, Ar, N2 and...Fe2O3? You're pretty sure that last one isn't a gas.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = Duna's rarefied atmospheric gas mixture at these altitudes is starting to separate, and concentrations of gases fluctuate with altitude.
		DunaFlyingHighMidlandSea = Concentrations of water vapour up here are slightly higher than the rest of the planet, but it's a small enough difference to be a blip.
