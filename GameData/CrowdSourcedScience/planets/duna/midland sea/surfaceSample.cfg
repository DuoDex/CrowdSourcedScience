		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You dig a little and find a perfectly preserved series of ripple marks from presumably billions of years ago.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = The darker ground here is much more compacted than the windblown sediments of elsewhere on Duna, as if laid down and cemented by water.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlandSea = You start to dig with trepidation at the possibility of finding water before you realise you left your sample container on the ship and have to anticlimatically go and fetch it.
