		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = You feel like a true hero as you march across the red planet, until you realize you're a long, long way from home.
		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The sand here is much too fine to make a sandcastle with so you decide to bound around for a bit. Mission Control orders you back to your tasks-you've come all this way, why can't you just have a few minutes of FUN!?
		DunaFlyingLowLowlands = The featureless plains stretch off into the distance. It's too cold here for any mirages.
		DunaFlyingLowLowlands = Even off the ground, the air is strangely calm. It's still really cold though, and that snaps you out of your feeling of unease.
		DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = It looks boring down there. Even the Midlands might be a more interesting place to land.
		DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = A dust storm front moves lazily across the flatlands, obscuring the surface behind it.
