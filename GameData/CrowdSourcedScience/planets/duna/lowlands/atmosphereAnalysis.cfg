		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The dust here is fine enough that the sensor doesn't get clogged for once! Rejoice!
		DunaFlyingLowLowlands = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into... *ahem*.
		DunaFlyingLowLowlands = You could get used to this, flying serenely through air-that's-not-really-there while scanning it with a gizmo.
		DunaFlyingHighLowlands = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also almost certainly higher.
		DunaFlyingHighLowlands = Still C02. Come to think of it, we're actually at the same altitude as everywhere else, just further off the ground. You think.
