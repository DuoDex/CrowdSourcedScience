		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The lands here produce no significant deviations from the Duna mean aside from a very slight lowering of gravity strength.
		DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Beep, boop. Beep, boop. Beep, boop. The noises of the sensor are more interesting than the results.
		DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = Down here, orbital coverage is relatively HD, yet still no anomalies show their heads. Keep looking.
		DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = Even KSC gets bored with the lack of anything happening and orders you to scan somewhere else.
		DunaInSpaceHighLowlands = All you're getting is the noise from nearby mountain ranges. Hopefully we'll find something once we get closer.
		DunaInSpaceHighLowlands = The sensor must be in the wrong way, because it's giving you some beautiful data on the Duna-Ike gravitational relationship but nothing from Duna.
