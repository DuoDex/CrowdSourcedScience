		DunaSrfLandedPoles = It feels as though a stiff breeze is tugging at your ankles. You suspect that this means gas is escaping from the ice caps, and this makes you slightly nervous.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = A sudden puff of gas makes you jump back from the geyser hole you were peering into.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = You see a far-off gas plume eject a large chunk of ice into the thin air. You consider jumping into one to see how high you can get.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = Everywhere you look, you see white. The undulating icy plains stretch toward the steeply curving horizon.
		DunaInSpaceLowPoles = The curving edge of the planet shows just a hint of red surrounding a sea of white ice below you. It's beautiful!
		DunaInSpaceLowPoles = The mountain chains are just visible as a series of wiggly lines stretching over the sea of white.
