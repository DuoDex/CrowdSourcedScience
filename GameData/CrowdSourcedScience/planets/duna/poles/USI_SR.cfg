		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The sensor is confused by the puffs of geyser gas.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = The sensor returns valuable data giving insight into the powerful katabatic winds that swirl around the polar zones.
		DunaFlyingHighPoles = Apparently now should be a good time to witness the formation of elusive polar ice clouds. Mission Control takes note.

		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The gizmo logs the regular rises and falls of atmospheric pressure with temperature.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = This data on aerial icing in cold Dunaian conditions will be useful if the KSC can find someone good enough to make a Duna aircraft.
		DunaFlyingHighPoles = There's not much atmosphere to get aero data on up here. Still, it records some faint high-altitude air currents.

		DunaSrfLandedPoles = These are the ideal conditions to test prolonged exposure to very cold air and its effects on metal fragility.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = You take the opportunity to test out several experimental wing de-icing compounds. None of them work, you'll just have to hope you don't get iced.
		DunaFlyingHighPoles = You're surprised to still encounter icing up here. That is, until the test material becomes so cold and brittle it breaks off.

		DunaSrfLandedPoles = Studying low temperatures and pressures simultaneously allows the engineers to strike a balance between keeping fuel liquid and preventing boiloff.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = You're not sure why they want to go to Duna's frozen wastes to help evaluate the camouflage ability of pink parachutes.
		DunaFlyingHighPoles = You underestimated the aerodynamic forces at this altitude and the smallest test components blow out of the bay.
