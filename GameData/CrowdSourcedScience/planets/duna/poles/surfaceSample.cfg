		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The outer icy crust appears to be made of an unusually dense ice. It gives off wisps of white vapour when held against your warm suit.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = On closer inspection, the ice from under the crust appears to have a jumbled hexa-cubic crystal structure rather than the standard tesselating hexagons found on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = This is a mixture of dry ice and water ice. And those pesky percholorates.
