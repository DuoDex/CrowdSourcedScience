		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The air is cold. The atmosphere must not support a strong greenhouse effect.
		DunaFlyingLowPoles = You wish you could drink a cup of hot chocolate, but you can't take your helmet off. The thermometer seems to be frozen solid.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Turning up the thermostat in your climate controlled suit does little to keep the cold from creeping into your toes.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The surface below glints white and is covered in craters. The temperature is a comfortable 5 degrees above absolute zero.
