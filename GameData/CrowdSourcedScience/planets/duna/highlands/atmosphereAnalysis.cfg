		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The more rarefied air up here displays marginally greater concentrations of argon and nitrogen over the denser carbon dioxide.
		DunaFlyingLowHighlands = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingLowHighlands = Not much air up here to carry the dust, but air currents from orographic lift carry the finest of particles over the summits.
		DunaFlyingHighHighlands = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
		DunaFlyingHighHighlands = Higher even than the mountaintops, extremely faint and wispy strips of cloud flow behind the mountain. Flying through them shows they are made of ice.
