		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Gravity here is slightly higher than elsewhere but less than expected.
		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You leave the scanner to do its thing and try not to worry about the dust ruining an 8,800-Fund piece of science kit.
		DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = The line on the readout jitters around as you pass over huge massifs and valleys.
		DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = Graphical output shows a classic crustal thickening pattern, but less pronounced that otherwise thought. Maybe Duna's crust is thick enough not to form mountain roots?
		DunaInSpaceHighHighlands = The gravimeter ticks up slightly when passing over the mountain belts.
		DunaInSpaceHighHighlands = Did one of those floating magic boulders fly past? Because something just spiked the gravioli count!
		//LAST_ENTRY
