		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The thin air is colder than anything you'd find on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = If the thermometer liquid wasn't in a pressurised tube, it'd freeze solid.
		DunaFlyingLowHighlands = The air is far too thin to conduct much heat away from the device.
		DunaFlyingLowHighlands = Rotating the thermometer away from the sun freezes the liquid, towards the sun warms it too much. Gah!
