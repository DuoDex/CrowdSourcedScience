		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The sun breaks through the thick haze, warming the thermometer enough for it to defrost and the gauge to become clearly visible again.
		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The cold sink nature of the canyon makes this place even more bitingly cold at nights.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = Above the dust, you can finally see the effect sunlight has on the temperature, as though the craft is basking in the feeble warmth.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The sinking cold air is below you up here, and mixes with slightly warmer air from other zones.
