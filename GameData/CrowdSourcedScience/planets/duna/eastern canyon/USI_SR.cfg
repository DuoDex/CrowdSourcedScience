		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = It's not so much the lack of a significant microclimate here so much as the lack of much climate at all that's slightly disconcerting.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = Dust content...high. Winds...fairly weak. Moisture content...minimal. Precipiation...none. Standard Duna stuff.
		DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon = If you position the sensor right, you might just about be able to catch the tiny wisps of atmosphere here to analyse.

		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = According to the box, the high concentrations of airborne iron oxide could be hazardous. Tell us something we don't know, sensor!
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = There is some air sinking into the chasm from the lower atmosphere, but not enough to pose a threat to craft.
		DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon = Where's the air we're supposed to do aeronomy on? There's nothing up here but (almost) space. Heh.

		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = Your ship is now the testbed, as the temperature swings have caused sections of paint to crack and peel from the exterior. That's a few more Funds on the paint budget, then.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = You're more interested in watching the swirls of dust below than actually testing this stuff. What? We ain't gonna learn much... Oh, fine. It'll be perfunctory, though.
		DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon = A barely detectable breeze tugs almost imperceptably at the corners of some of the fabrics. The Extend-O-Matic flag might not be needed here.

		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The conditions down here seem quite benign, if too dusty for most of the parts. Self-cleaning air filters would be great here, though.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The parts all seem to pass their Duna-worthiness test, though we'll see how well they fare on the surface.
		DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon = ZAP! OW! ...Lesson learned, do not poke the electronics while a round of conductivity testing is running.
