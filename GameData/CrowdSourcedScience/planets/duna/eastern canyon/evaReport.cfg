		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = You want to stand on a rock and strike a dramatic pose, but you can't find a big enough one in the thick haze.
		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = Dust-that's all you can see. You daren't wander too far from the ship in case you can't find it again.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The dust is still thick, but does thin out a little when off the surface. Still can't see much, though.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = You look down, and try to make out patterns in the swirling dust. That's a... swirly thing. That's another swirly thing.
		DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = This canyon is by far the biggest of Duna's great scars, slicing through plains and hills alike.
		DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = If you tilt your head sideways, you could swear the canyon looks like a crooked smiley face. What do you mean, 'you're seeing things'?
