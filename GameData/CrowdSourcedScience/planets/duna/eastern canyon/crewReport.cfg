		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The canyon is so huge and dusty you can't see the other wall. It makes you feel perticularly small. Well... OK, stop rubbing it in, Duna!
		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = The air is thick with dust down here, and the haze reduces visibility to a couple of hundred metres or so.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = There's so much dust you can barely see the ground. You're flying blind with only the altimeter to tell you of the nearby ground.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = The dust clouds roil past the window, as though the very air is alive with sand.
