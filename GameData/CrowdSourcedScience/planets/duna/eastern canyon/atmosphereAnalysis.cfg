		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = There seems to be LOT more dust down here in the thicker canyon air, which acts as a dust sink for the surrounding hills.
		DunaFlyingLowEasternCanyon = Wow, that's a lot of dust down below. So much, it's still detectable in the air above.
		DunaFlyingHighEasternCanyon = The canyon is so large, it even causes the streams of upper-atmosphere dust and denser gases to sink into it.
