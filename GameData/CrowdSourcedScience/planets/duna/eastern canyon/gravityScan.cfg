		DunaSrfLandedEasternCanyon = That's a big bump on the Kouguer graph, which suggests significant crustal thinning is present in the area.
		DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = Readings scroll across the screen, and when you pass over the canyon gravity drops slightly while the Kouguer reading spikes.
		DunaInSpaceHighEasternCanyon = While the machine beeps and whirrs doing its thing, you invent the new sport of zero-G wall tennis with a crumpled page from a safety manual as the ball and a book as the bat.
