		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = Winds gust gently northwest up the canyon, remaining reasonably constant at all times.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The winds up here are the standard east-west patterns, whatever it is must be a very low-level channeling effect.
		DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon = You find stronger high-altitude winds and higher quantities of fine lowlands dust up here, you must be getting close to the source of the climate cells.

		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = A solar flare alert from KSC lets you attune the detector to log cosmic radiation to see how effectively the Dunain atmosphere blocks it.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = All this really teaches you is that the Dunaian atmosphere is very thin and presents little hazard to ships and engine efficiency.
		DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon = There's so little atmosphere up here, why bother running tests on it? Wernher won't notice a few fudged results.

		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You can't do very much from this relatively benign (for Duna) environment. You start to doze off on the monitoring panel.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = Several shades of paint have been brought to determine which one blends in with the landcape the most. #ff461e looks the best.
		DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon = A slight gust of wind is all it takes for all the paint to fall off one sample. Result: Not good in cold, thin air.

		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You brought along a small wind turbine to evaluate its usefulness here; and these fairly gentle, constant winds let you discover its uselessness.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The fine dust seems to decrease in proportion as altitude decreases, which is fortunate since it's especially lethal to electronics.
		DunaFlyingHighWesternCanyon = The computer running the test crashes suddenly as a spike in solar radiation is recorded. Note to self: Bring more shielding.
