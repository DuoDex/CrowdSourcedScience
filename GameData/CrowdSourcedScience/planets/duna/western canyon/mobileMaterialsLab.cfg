		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You get the standard Duna reaction from most is the samples (i.e. going slightly red and cold). However, you put one of the lithium hydroxide C02 scrubbers from the capsule into the bay as an afterthought, and watch it form a white, powdery coating.
		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = The dust that blows into the bay appears to be from two sources, as it forms two different piles of fine and grainier sand.
