		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = The lack of any gravimetric anomalies here and the proximity to an ex-sea suggests this valley was carved by water or other erosional processes.
		DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = The needle dips slightly as you pass over the chasm, but there are no singnificant tectonic-associated changes.
		DunaInSpaceHighWesternCanyon = Whatever impact that canyon has, it must be pretty small as you aren't getting much from way up here.
