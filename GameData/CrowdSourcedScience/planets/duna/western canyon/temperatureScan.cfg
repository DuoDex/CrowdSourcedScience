		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = This canyon doesn't seem as cold as one would expect govn its cold sink status.
		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = It's warmer than expected in here. Either it's radiation off the walls or lack of much wind chill.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The thicker air here wicks away heat from the thermometer more effectively than elsewhere.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The canyon walls are channelling warmer air from the Midland Sea to the south, but at a relatively slow wind speed.
