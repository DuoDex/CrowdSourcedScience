		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You look down one end of the canyon, and then look down the other end. It's very disorienting, and you'd hate to get lost here.
		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You pull out a pair of binoculars and look at the wall just in time to see a huge boulder fall from the precipice and crash to the canyon floor. The sound doesn't make it to your position.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = From up here you can see both walls. Quite the narrow canyon indeed; perfect for some high-speed hovering-craft racing!
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The straightness of the walls you can see makes your eyes start to water.
		DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = The great scar in the landscape below links two of the biggest basins on Duna like some kind of great cutting.
		DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = Zooming in, you see half a crater on the edge of the canyon. Was it made by half a meteorite, or has the rest fallen into the canyon as it widened?
