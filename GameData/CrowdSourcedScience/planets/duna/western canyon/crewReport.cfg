		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = This canyon looks pretty narrow and relatively dust free, letting you get a clear view of the walls.
		DunaSrfLandedWesternCanyon = You imagine the canyon as a groove in a giant, red vinyl record. Actually, maybe music-loving aliens built this?
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = You look down, and hope you don't land on one of the steep walls. That would be... problematic.
		DunaFlyingLowWesternCanyon = The canyon stretches off to the hazy horizon in both directions. You feel like you've said something similar before.
