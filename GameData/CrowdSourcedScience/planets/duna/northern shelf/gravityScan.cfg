		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The sensor attempts to measure the gravity through the craft's shaking in the winds. Eventally, it gives up and asks for a shock absorber.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The wind drops for long enough to allow the meter to complete its readings. Gravity looks to be ever so slightly lower here, but internal structure is the same.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The local gravity strength dips extremely noticeably (well, relatively speaking) as you pass over the huge chasm.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The various gravimetric lines go crazy, probably related to the giant canyon below. You didn't need this fancy kit to spot it.
		DunaInSpaceHighNorthernShelf = Even from high orbit, the effects of the canyon appear clearly on the readout.
		DunaInSpaceHighNorthernShelf = "Pilot! Follow that anomaly!". Huehuehue. Always wanted to say that.
		//LAST_ENTRY
