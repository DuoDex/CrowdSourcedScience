		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = A blast of howling wind almost blows you off your feet as sand clatters against your visor plate.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The even-more-freezing-than-usual wind bites into your toes. Where could it possibly be coming from?
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The sand grains flying past swirl and rub against each other as an even more huge dust storm front bears down on you from the north. The air around you crackles with static electricity that makes your hair stand up.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = You struggle to maintain your aerial position in the winds and consider tying yourself to the craft.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = There is an eerie lull in the weather, and for a few seconds the dust clears enough for you to marvel at the canyon's vast scale.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = That's a big scar. Duna must have been in a serious fight at some point.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = The waves of airborne sand blowing through the canyon below form beautiful patterns over the surface.
