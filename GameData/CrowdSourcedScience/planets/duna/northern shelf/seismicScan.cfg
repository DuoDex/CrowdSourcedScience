		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The wind rattles the seismometer so much it's impossible to get a reading. Apparently, this is a magnitude VI dunaquake, if such a thing exists.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = In amongst all the vibration noise, the meter picks up a tiny rumble from deep beneath the ground. Could this place be a relic of an ancient fault line?
