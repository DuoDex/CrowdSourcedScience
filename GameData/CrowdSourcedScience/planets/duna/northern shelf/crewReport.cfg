		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = You squint through the dust-are those mountains off in the distance? ...Those aren't mountains-they're canyon walls!
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = With the craft now still, the red Dunaian sand starts to pile up on the window. You try to tap the window to knock it off, until a wind gust does that for you.

		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = A powerful gust of wind shakes the capsule violently and a long-forgotten snack falls out of the overhead locker.
