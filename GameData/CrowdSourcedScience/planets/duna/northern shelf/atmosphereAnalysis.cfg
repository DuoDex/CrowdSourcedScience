		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The winds blowing down the canyon from the north carry with them the faintest traces of ice crystals.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The detector finds a tiny wisp of krypton-then it's gone. Superkerbal better stay away.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = The analyser bleeps loudly over the noise of the wind, signifying the completion of its analysis.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = The air here looks normal, if a little thicker thanks to the low altitude. And it's still really dusty.
		DunaFlyingHighNorthernShelf = The Northern Shelf and its influence on the atmosphere is far below you.
		DunaFlyingHighNorthernShelf = A dust particle that gets caught in the sensor turns out to be from the Northern Basin-is this evidence of global air currents?
