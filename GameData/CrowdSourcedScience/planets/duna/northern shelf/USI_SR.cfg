		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = The winds look to be katabatic in nature, being strongest when warmest and coldest and reversing diurnally and seasonally.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = The anemometer broke, the barometer thinks it's upside down and the windblown dust is making short work of the cardboard housing.

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = Dust grains rubbing against each other in midair generate a weak but measurable static charge.
		DunaFlyingLowNorthernShelf = Even though the air is thin, the powerful winds here still produce large amounts of aero forces.

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = Well, the samples box is gone. We learned you shouldn't bring things to the Northern Shelf that are made of cardboard.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = Turns out the winds here will shred anything not made of metal into ribbons. Who'd have thought?

		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = All of the electronic components failed almost immediately after being exposed to the maelstron outside. Looks like any colony will have to be made of some sturdy stuff.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthernShelf = One of the larger parts broke away from its mount. We need stronger screws for this.
