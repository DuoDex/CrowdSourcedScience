		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = You look out and see a network of tunnels running beneath the ice to a nearby hole, and try not to think about what this says about the ice.
		DunaSrfLandedPoalrHighlands = The craft briefly slides and judders over the ice before coming to a stop. It takes a while to let go of the grip handles.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = The icy hills stretch out in all directions beneath you. The ice glare makes it difficult to look down.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = You find a page in the safety manual on how to deal with space polar bear attacks. Unfortunately, all it says is "run away".
