		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Picking up a Kerbin-sized hunk of ice is easy. If you entered a strongkerbal contest remotely, you would win gold!
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarHighlands = Slight variations in gravity hint at the presence of entire moutains buried deep within the ice.
		DunaInSpaceHighPolarHighlands = Doing a cartwheel takes no effort. You accidentally hit a switch while spinning, hopefully it didn't do anything.
