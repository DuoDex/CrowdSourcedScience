		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Atmospheric pressure seems to experience measurable diurnal fluctuations.
