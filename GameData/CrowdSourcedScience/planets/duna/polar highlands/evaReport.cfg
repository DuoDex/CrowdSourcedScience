		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = From this elevated vantage point you can see the dazzling pinkish hills stretching into the distance.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = You look back at your ship and see large amounts of vapour hissing from under it. You hope it isn't about to sink into the ice.

		DunaInSpaceLowPolarHighlands = The icy hills glint in the sunlight far below you. You wonder if there are any UFOs buried down there.
