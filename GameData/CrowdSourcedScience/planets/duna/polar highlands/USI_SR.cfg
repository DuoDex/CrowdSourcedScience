		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Brr. You don't need a sensor to tell you the air is freezing and falling to the ground outside.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = You get some good readings on how the local topography deflects the katabatic wind systems.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarHighlands = High-altitude air currents of sinking polar air are recorded, suggesting the presence of atmospheric polar vortices.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The numerous hollows and valleys channel the air currents into low-altitude wind streams and vortices.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = The icing detector has developed so much ice it's stopped working.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarHighlands = Flying through a polar cloud at extremely high speeds causes the minute ice crystals to 'iceblast' the sensor.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Repeated freeze-thaw cycles and biting cold makes this an extremely harsh environment for materials.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = Freezing air currents from the hills below and thermals over darker spots subject the materials to significant temperature swings.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarHighlands = Just for fun, you shake the craft to try and dislodge some of the ice. You manage to dislodge the sensor instead, and find shaking the craft had voided the warranty.

		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The peristent freezing temperatures will permit detailed study into the effects of long-term cold on battery degradation.
		DunaFlyingLowPolarHighlands = The laser altimeter you were supposed to test doesn't seem to be affected by the cold and high albedo, so you take the opportunity to do some aerial topographic mapping.
		DunaFlyingHighPolarHighlands = The thin, cold atmosphere up here does little to keep the temperature even on the sunward and shadowed sides of the craft.
