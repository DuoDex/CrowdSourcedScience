		SunInSpaceLow = The temperatures are off the chart. Check that, the chart just burned up. You wonder what it said...
		SunInSpaceLow = You look at the display and realize that you probably won't need the oven to heat your food.
		SunInSpaceLow = It's hot. What did you expect?
		SunInSpaceLow = You come to the shocking conclusion that temperature readings here are considerably high.
		SunInSpaceLow = The temperature is hard to read as the paint melts from the surface of the instrument.
		SunInSpaceLow = The weather today is warm, with a risk of heat wave in the corona. Kerbals above the age of seventy are advised to stay inside if they wish their miraculous survival streak to continue.
		SunInSpaceLow = The recording confirms your suspicion that it is in fact, very hot.
		SunInSpaceLow = The wires in temperature read-outs have melted, giving blatantly incorrect readings.
		SunInSpaceLow = Wow! This place is almost as hot as the surface of the... Oh, wait.
		SunInSpaceLow = Your thermometer appears to be stuck at "MAX".
		SunInSpaceLow = The thermometer has exploded. You really wish you could've seen it.
		SunInSpaceLow = I think it just broke.
		SunInSpaceLow = It is quite hot. Mission Control asks if this experiment was necessary.
		SunInSpaceLow = According to the thermometer, the Sun is hot. Fascinating.
		SunInSpaceLow = I think the thermometer just exploded.
		SunInSpaceLow = Though the thermometer has melted, you're able to take an guesstimated reading.
		SunInSpaceLow = It seems the cookies are burning...
		SunInSpaceLow = The thermometer doesn't look like it was constructed to handle this kind of heat.
		SunInSpaceLow = Mission Control assured you that the extremely high temperatures are perfectly harmless.
		SunInSpaceLow = Hot stuff!
		SunInSpaceLow = "HOT!" Seems about right.
		SunInSpaceLow = It's hot here. What a surprise!
		SunInSpaceLow = The thermometer seems to have melted. You can assume that it is rather toasty outside.
		SunInSpaceLow = It's off the scale!
		SunInSpaceLow = The thermometer is on fire.
		SunInSpaceLow = Mission Controls observes the readings and formally requests the crew to back off a few million meters.
