		SunInSpaceLow = You wonder if you could fry an egg here.
		SunInSpaceLow = You decide that Mission Control decided to send you here because they wanted to see how good fried kerbonaut is.
		SunInSpaceLow = You are almost more amazed that you got here than at the fact that you haven't melted yet.
		SunInSpaceLow = You close your eyes. The sun is still clearly visible!
		SunInSpaceLow = All your snacks are getting crispy and brown around the edges. Luckily, you prefer them well done.
		SunInSpaceLow = As the craft gets closer to Kerbol, you start to feel the effects of the heat on the craft. You break out the extra water, and make a note.
		SunInSpaceLow = You ask Mission Control why they put you so close to Kerbol. They respond: "Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT." You can only wonder what that's supposed to mean.
		SunInSpaceLow = You put on your spacesuit and activate the air conditioning.
		SunInSpaceLow = Your personal freezer isn't working particularly well anymore and all your ice cream has melted.
		SunInSpaceLow = You are pretty sure being this close to the sun isn't safe.
		SunInSpaceLow = You look out the window trying to see something. Log: "Breath makes window foggy. Momentarily dissipates. Causes dizziness if repeated in rapid succession."
		SunInSpaceLow = "Is it just me, or is it getting really hot in here?"
		SunInSpaceLow = Theories predict that, at this distance, neutrino radiation is so high that you might even detect a collision.
		SunInSpaceLow = You feel nervous as the sun's radiation blasts the windows. It's like a hand reaching out towards your spacecraft.
		SunInSpaceLow = Your very expensive sunglasses seem to have no use here.
		SunInSpaceLow = You decide that Kerbolar wind won't be a good candidate for exhaustive atmospheric analysis.
		SunInSpaceLow = Why me?
		SunInSpaceLow = You look through the window. And then you realize that the only thing you can see is a giant ball of plasma.
		SunInSpaceLow = Looking through your cockpit window, you now understand the expression "Light at the end of the tunnel".
		SunInSpaceLow = How did I... get here?
		SunInSpaceLow = "'Go to space,' they said. 'It'll be fun,' they said..."
		SunInSpaceLow = "Ohhh, the Sun. I'm gonna meet the Sun. Oh no! What'll I say? 'Hi! Hi, Sun!' Oh, boy!"
		SunInSpaceLow = You question the safety of this mission.
		SunInSpaceLow = Mission Control questions your choice of orbit, but at least you will get a nice tan.
		SunInSpaceLow = You record the lack of sunglasses on the spacecraft.
		SunInSpaceLow = Good thing we brought sunglasses.
		SunInSpaceLow = You might want to put on some sunglasses.
		SunInSpaceLow = Since you're really close to the Sun, you decide to put on your sunglasses.
		SunInSpaceLow = You're starting to think getting this close to the Sun was a very bad idea.
		SunInSpaceLow = You are going to have some really weird tan lines when you get back.
		SunInSpaceLow = It's so shiny, you wanna touch it!
		SunInSpaceLow = The radiation causes a tingly sensation.
		SunInSpaceLow = You wonder how long mission control wishes to fry you for.
		SunInSpaceLow = A large curlicue of plasma comes off the sun. You wonder what it is.
		SunInSpaceLow = You see a few large sunspots. They look like really big dents.
		SunInSpaceLow = You realize that the sun is very hot, maybe you should come back at night.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You stare up at space. And to the left at space. And to the right. You slowly realize that pretty much everywhere you look at is space.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The crew seems to have forgotten their sunscreen.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades. Also the sun.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You check your snack stores again, hoping they will last through the mission.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You are feeling extremely lost and lonely.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You realize the sun won't be setting anytime soon and wish you had installed some window shades.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You are bored, as nothing of interest is happening.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You press your face against the window and gaze at the wonders of space... only to be cut off by Mission Control reminding you to write a report.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You close your eyes. That seems to be the only way to make the sun disappear.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You gaze into open space, and you just can't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You realize that you forgot to pack some snacks. You wonder if it is too late to turn back.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You decide that now would be a good time to take another nap.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Are we there yet? Huh? HUH? ARE WE THERE YET?!?
		SunInSpaceHigh = You see a bright, shiny object in the sky... and wonder to yourself... did I leave the stove on?
		SunInSpaceHigh = You don't much feel like going outside.
		SunInSpaceHigh = "I wish I'd packed that sun tan lotion."
		SunInSpaceHigh = You perceive a small flash of white light at the edge of your vision.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Are we there yet?
		SunInSpaceHigh = It's actually really boring out here.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Did something move past the capsule's window, or was that just a radiation-induced hallucination?
		SunInSpaceHigh = Wow, what a beautiful galaxy! Wait... that's a smudge on the window. A beautiful smudge.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The crew contemplates the rocket's infinite cosmic potential... and its cramped living space.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Interplanetary space, with nothing to look at but the stars, makes you feel lonely.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You can't believe leaving your hot dog outside didn't heat it up.
