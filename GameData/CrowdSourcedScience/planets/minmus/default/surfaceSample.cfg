		MinmusSrfLanded = As you gather up some Minmus material, you label it as "Definitely not ice".
		MinmusSrfLanded = You scoop a sample up to be analyzed back home, then smear some over your gloves to sniff when you get back in the capsule. You bet it'll smell minty and delicious.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You taste the sample, and find that it does not taste like mint at all. You wonder where the medicine cabinet went.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You are disappointed to discover that the sample does not taste like ice cream, but instead tastes more like frozen yogurt.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control tentatively asks you how it tastes.
		MinmusSrfLanded = After excavating the surface, you find a hidden ice layer. The ice appears to have a slightly greenish tinge to it. Upon further examination, you find it to have the perfect consistency for snow-cones, yet the taste leaves much to be desired.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You try to taste the sample but your helmet gets in the way.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The white mountains have a snow-like surface. The frozen lakes seem to be made of the same substance, but much smoother.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Must... not... taste...
		MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Surface samples confirm that it is not made out of mint, even though it looks and tastes like it.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You ask Mission Control if the substance could be marketed as some sort of air freshener. They consider your request. 
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains.
