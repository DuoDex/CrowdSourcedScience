		MinmusSrfLanded = The Goo starts to bounce slowly from top to bottom.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The Goo begins to resemble a particularly delicious bowl of rocky minty ice cream you had once. You slap yourself out of it.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = The Goo looks greener than ever.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = You feel like eating the Goo.
