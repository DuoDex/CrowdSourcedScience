		BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.
		BopInSpaceLow = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
		BopInSpaceLow = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
		BopInSpaceLow = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it's hiding some dark secret...
		BopInSpaceHigh = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because youâ€™ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
		BopInSpaceHigh = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can't help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Stuck in an eccentric, inclined orbit, this rock offers nothing to look at. A complete waste of time.
