// This file adds support for the KSP Interstellar mod by FractalUK.
// http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839
//
// Because of the absence of FractalUK there is no update for KSP 0.90
// available. Instead, you can download an unofficial update of Boris-Barboris.

//
// There are 6 experiments available for all planets/biomes. Additional files
// supporting this mod are located throughout as 'KSPI.cfg'
