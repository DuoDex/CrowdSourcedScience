		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The graviolis all squish over to the near side of Farside Crater.		
		MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = The graviolis report nominal readings for a crater this size. Maybe the next one will change things up.
		MunInSpaceHighFarsideCrater = The Mun's low gravity seems ideal for orbital infrastructure. You hope you live long enough to help make that happen.
