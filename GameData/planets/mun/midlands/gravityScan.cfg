		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The gravioli curve here is smooth with no anomalies.  For once.
		MunInSpaceLowMidlands = You're not too sure which of the scary-looking numbers (and letters!) on the screen are relevant to your situation. So you just write them all down and send them off to the guys back at KSC.
		MunInSpaceHighMidlands = Watching the graviolis work is incredibly satisfying even if you aren't too keen on the math involved.
