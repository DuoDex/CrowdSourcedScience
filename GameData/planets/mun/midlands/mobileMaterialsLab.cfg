		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The munar soil has mixed with one of the materials, producing a gray paste that is getting everywhere.
		MunInSpaceLow = Watching the surface below, you can't help but think how great it would be if you had a munar surface sample to study using the equipment in your lavishly-equipped lab.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your lab is going through materials at an alarming rate. Perhaps you shouldn't have replaced the entire bottom rack with snacks.
