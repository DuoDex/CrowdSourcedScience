		MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = You should have brought your golf club.
		MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Hmm... this Northwest Crater doesn't appear to be as round as some of the other ones. Perhaps the lava cooled unevenly. Or something.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Huh the Mun looks surprisingly like the one in your high school textbook. Probably the end result of hundreds of years of Kerbal curiosity. And telescopes. Really big telescopes.
