		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = You begin to indicate concerns regarding whether or not the landing was simply an elaborate hoax, but the communications are interrupted by a strange voice telling you to keep quiet.		
		MunInSpaceLow = You wonder if your report can even make it back to Kerbin from here - you are on the Farside of the Mun, after all.
		MunInSpaceLow = You report to Mission Control that you have found no evidence of the long-standing claim that a cow jumped over the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Wow the Mun looks pretty beat up. Look at all those holes.
