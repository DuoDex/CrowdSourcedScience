		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = The graviolis seem to be distributed directly between the two craters.		
		MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = The gravitational anomalies below don't seem to fit the usual explanation of basaltic lava flows. The scientists at KSC are determined to find an alternative theory.
		MunInSpaceHighTwinCraters = The Twin Crater's gravitational signature is quite unique. Not surprising considering its unique features.
