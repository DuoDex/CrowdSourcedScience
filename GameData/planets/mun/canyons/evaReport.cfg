		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You spot a narrow part of the canyon, and wonder if you could make the jump across.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there.
		MunInSpaceLowCanyons = There are visible striations in the walls of the canyons.
		MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The canyons below look particularly fun to climb. If only you weren't moving t such a high relative velocity...
		MunInSpaceHigh = Say are those the Munar Canyons down below? They sure are impressive. Nothing like Kerbin's of course.
