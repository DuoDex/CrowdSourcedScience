		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The vista from here is very distracting, so it takes you some extra time to complete your report.
		MunInSpaceLow = Oh dear, it seems that you have misplaced your snack inside the materials bay. Now you can't tell what's edible and what's not.
		MunInSpaceHigh = This particular experiment is from an elementary science class that won a national contest. Neat!
