		DunaSrfLandedPoles = It feels as though a stiff breeze is tugging at your ankles. You suspect that this means gas is escaping from the ice caps, and this makes you slightly nervous.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Luckily the Duna atmosphere is thin. Otherwise you and your craft would get separated very quickly pulling a stunt like this.
		DunaInSpaceLowPoles = The curving edge of the planet shows just a hint of red surrounding a sea of white ice below you. It's beautiful!
