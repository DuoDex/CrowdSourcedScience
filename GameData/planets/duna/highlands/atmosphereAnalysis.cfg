		DunaSrfLandedHighlands = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaFlyingLowHighlands = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingHighHighlands = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
