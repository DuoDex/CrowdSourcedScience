		DunaSrfLandedCraters = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
		DunaFlyingLowCraters = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
		DunaFlyingHighCraters = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
