        LaytheSrfLandedShores = The Goo bubbles and burps a little.
        LaytheFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be shivering. Perhaps the draft is making it cold?
        LaytheFlyingHigh = The Goo is pulsing gently. It is 15% more radioactive than when in Laythe's atmosphere.
        LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems comfortable.
