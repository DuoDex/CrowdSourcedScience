		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere is very, very cold indeed. Some of the sensors have frozen shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's a tiny bit nippy here.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The air is dry and cold here. It's almost like you are standing in a walk-in freezer.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The cold air has caused some of the instruments to stop functioning.  You send the results you can back to KSC and settle down with a mug of hot cocoa and some snacks.
		KErbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You feel sorry for the atmospheric sensor, exposed as it is to the subzero temperatures of Kerbin's polar regions.
		KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps = Even this far away the Ice Caps seem to be sucking the heat and moisture from the atmosphere around you.  We're not going to land down there, are we?
		KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps = Atmospheric analysis is complete. Can we go home now? It's cold.
