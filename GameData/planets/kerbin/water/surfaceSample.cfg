		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You make sure to include some plankton in your sample for the folks back at KSC.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You scoop up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample, you hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = There seems to be a lot of a liquid substance. Surely this will be a huge advancement in science as we know it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = This material seems to take on the shape of what looks like a Kerbin container. More study is needed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You seem to have captured a small crustacean. Mission Control is less than impressed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Curious - something essential to life that isn't green, isn't explosive, and doesn't start with "K".
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = "Di-hydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You somehow managed to catch a fish. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit in your pocket.
