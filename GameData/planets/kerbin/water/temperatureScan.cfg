		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You ensure that the thermometer is adequately sealed. You wouldn't want to release mercury into the sea.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The salty water has encrusted the thermometer and you are unable to get an accurate reading.  So you make something up.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water is colder than the surrounding air.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You have to stick your head underwater in order to see what the thermometer says.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = The air seems to be cooled by the water, and the temperature is lower that average here.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You keep an eye out for sudden tsunamis as the thermometer takes its reading of the surrounding air.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It appears to be the perfect snack-eating temperature.  You open a box just to be sure.  For science.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Sitting inside your climate-controlled cockpit, you find that you don't really care what the thermometer thinks of the outside temperature. 
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The temperature scan is inconclusive, but you bet it's chilly out there.  You tell KSC about your supposition.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You specifically bought one of those fancy low-gravity thermometers for this experiment.
