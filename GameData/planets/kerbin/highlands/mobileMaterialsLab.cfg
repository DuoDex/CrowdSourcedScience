		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Most of the materials in the lab have either boiled off or frozen at this altitude.  You decide that it's not worth the effort to do research, and decide to have some snacks instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = One of your samples gets loose and you have to go and chase it down as it rolls down the hill.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You find it difficult to concentrate on your lab research flying this close to the peaks below.  You write down some random gibberish to send back to KSC.
		KerbinFlyingLow = You hope the autopilot keeps you from crashing into any stray hills as you play with the materials lab.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Almost above the mountains and into space.  When we get there we should have some snacks.  You know, as a reward for awesomeness.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You're quite certain the hills of the Highlands don't grow this high and so you are able to relax and focus on your experiment.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You pull out your trusty lab notebook to make a note of what you observe. After 2 minutes of searching for a pencil you remember you are in space now, and find it floating in a corner.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You perform your experiments with a rock from the Highlands as a guest of honor.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you finish your lab experiments one of the massive peaks below catches your eye. It's amazing how small things look from way up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you write up your lab report, you marvel at how smooth Kerbin looks despite the Highlands.
