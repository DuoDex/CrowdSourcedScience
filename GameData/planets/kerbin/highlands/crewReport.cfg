		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = KSC, we have landed. I think. The altimeter still shows way too high for us to be on the ground, but our velocity is zero. So there you have it. Maybe.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Landing in the Highlands woohoo! Break out the celebratory kilts and bagpipes!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = There can be only one report from the Highlands!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = *singing* "Colorado Rocky Mountain high. I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky". Ah, good 'ol John Denver.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You feel a certain satisfaction at being higher than the Highlands.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Yep, we're in space alright, but you bet that if we left the landing gear down it would hit that mountaintop.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You observe the  Highlands from orbit, marveling at how tiny they look.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You become homesick thinking about the mountains of Kerbin being the closest part of the planet to you at this altitude. Then you have some snacks, and it's all better.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Is it still the Highlands if you're over a quarter million meters above it?
