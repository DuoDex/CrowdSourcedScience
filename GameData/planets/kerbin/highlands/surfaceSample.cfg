		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Dirt, grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a ground breaking discovery.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You discover dried out straw, lichens, and moss.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You find a tiny fleck of a shiny yellow material among the rocks. It seems that there is gold in these hills.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The rocks here are far more interesting than the ones you find elsewhere. You pick up a few to add to your rock collection.
