		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = A blade of grass gets caught in the outer casing of the sensor, and obstructs your view of the display.  Oh well, we'll just make something up.  They'll never know anyway.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = As you painstakingly jot down the data, you wonder why you couldn't just take it from the morning news weather report.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Instead of sending Mission Control your barometer data, you just send them a copy of this morning's weather report.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Barometric pressure: 300 millibars.  Or is that 3000?  Whatever....look at the view down there.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = "The weather will remain pleasant," declares the barometer.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it snack time yet? It has to be snack time.  No pressure readings till after snack time.
