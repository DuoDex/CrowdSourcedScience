		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The graviolis seem strangely attracted to the grass.  There aren't more of them, but they seem more content here.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The grass doesn't seem to be too bothered by gravity. Look at them, swaying in the wind and such.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = You happily munch on a snack while performing a gravity scan over the Grasslands.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = A scientist at KSC once told you that without gravity, the grass would grow into outer space! On second thought, he probably wasn't a real scientist.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The instrument surveys the gravity over the Grasslands. It appears the field is very stable here.
		KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = Gravity scans over the Grasslands are normal...too normal. You begin to suspect that the grass is hiding something.
		KerbinInSpaceHighGrasslands = As you fly high over the Grasslands you can feel the graviolis swarming around you. They seem excited.
