		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You look forward to opening the capsule door and smelling the fresh earthy smell of grass.  Oh yeah, we have to wear these stupid spacesuits even on Kerbin.  Whose great idea was that?
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The crew is embroiled in an argument over whether the grass is in fact greener on the other side.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = There's something on the wing, some.....thing....
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = It's very comforting to see this much green below you.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The ground here has been highly manicured. You note the number of groundskeepers the planet must have.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = A golf ball pings against the side of the spaceship.  How the heck did someone hit a ball that hard??
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You can't smell the cows anymore.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Even from space the vast swaths of grass appear a technicolor green.  You feel proud to have come from such a beautiful place.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You marvel at how beautifully-manicured kerbalkind's lawn is.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You strain to see detail on the surface below, but all that you can see are the broad strokes of biomes below.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You hope that when you come back, you'll land in the Grasslands.
