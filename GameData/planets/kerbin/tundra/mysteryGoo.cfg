		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The Goo challenges you to a snowball fight. You cheat and use your opposable thumbs to great advantage.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The Goo seems to have shrunk into a pea size ball.  You consider eating it, but decide to just throw it outside the door instead.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo shrivels in the harsh wind and asks you to close the canister.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The Goo holds on to the container lid for dear life.  It appears as though you are caught in a life-or-death struggle.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo seems to be shrinking away from the sight of the landscape below.  You don't know if this is normal, or if you should be feeding it more snacks.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The Goo is...definitely doing something. You scribble something to that effect in your report, serene in the knowledge that you're not the one who has to read it.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo immediately stops what it's doing when you peek inside the canister. Very suspicious.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be cavitating at 33.47652 MHz. Strange. You wonder what that means.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You let the Goo out. It seems to like space as much as you do. Maybe it wants to grow up to be an astronaut.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = After having yet another box of snacks you decide to check on the Goo and find it spilled all over the floor.  See, this is why we can't have nice things.
