		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You look out the window and can no longer remember if you've already returned from a mission or are yet to depart.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You think you should get inside the VAB and discuss if the rocket is good enough.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = As you sit in the capsule, you can't help but wonder why you haven't taken off yet.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This is our Space Center. We're home.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Was a rocket really necessary to get here?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Deja Vu!
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You should probably climb the VAB! 
		KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = You watch Montimer swing a golf ball into the pond. 
		KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = You are just happy that we didn't land on any of the new recruits.
		KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = You pretend to be the Crawler driver. After a few minutes you realize that you'd rather fly to space. 
		KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = You wonder if this will be the site of your grave marker. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You look up at the stars and begin to count. You realize you should take off before you fall asleep.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You regret wearing a red shirt to work today.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You're not sure this is the right place to be.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You are waiting impatiently.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Are we going to launch? If not, I want cookies."
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You pause for a moment to rethink your life.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Are we there yet?"
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You pick up your pencil, but get distracted by the thought of space.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = This place looks very familiar.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = "Ignition, check. Fuel gauge, check. Parachute, check. Microwave, check. Wait, microwave?"
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You mutter a personal version of Shepard's Prayer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You get impatient and try to find the launch button so you can go to space already.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The launchpad... very interesting terrain we have here.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder why you experienced over 3 gs when the rocket was moved to the pad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Just a heads' up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Are we there yet?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = “Wait! Let me out, I changed my mind!"
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Check ignition and may Von Kerman's love be with you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder what that nasty smell is. Either there is a serious propellant leak or Bob had burritos for lunch. Again.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You examine the blinking lights and stare intensely at the fuel gauges. Looks like we are ready to go.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control reminds you that getting out and pushing is often a viable tactic.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you're in space. 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You wonder where Gunther Wendt.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Flipping trough the Prelaunch Checklist you open a page that simply reads "Your Commercials could be here". You finally realize that Montimer is overtaxing his authority - literary.
		KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission report: we didn't go very far.  Can't you see me waving at you?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You think that you should be flying the craft instead of making boring logs.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a piece of paper from your notepad and draw a spaceplane on it.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Despite its name, the runway does not actually run.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The runway seems to run a long way.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = There's a nice view of mission control from here. You can see them waving back.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a sip of a soft drink before igniting the engines. Or was that after?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Don't buzz the tower. The guy paying your salary is standing there and he doesn't want his coffee spilled.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = “Clear Right. Clear Left. We're good here. Ground control come in. Over."
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Reporting from the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of traffic, because I don't think we ever got the clearance to be here.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = This runway needs a ramp.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = You hope they can still roll the planes out, having landed this close to the SPH.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Whew, that was a close one, we almost hit the SPH!
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You notice that your ship looks strangely similar to the tanks over there.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = You feel inadequate in your little ship surrounded by all these huge tanks.
		KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = You consider jumping out of the spacecraft and climbing the water tower.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = You sure hope they can track you from here.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You make loud noises into your comms headset, wondering if there will be a feedback loop this close to the tracking dish.
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = So, what was the point of this flight again?
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = All the way to the south tracking dish.  Now we're exploring the universe (one small step at a time).
		KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = Look ma, no hands! 
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = There seem to be a lot of strange green lifeforms building something here.  Oh yeah, we're still at the VAB.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Wow, that was a short trip!
		KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = Take THAT memorial! This is a REAL ship!
		KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = We really should have landed INSIDE the tank.
		KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = Nice piloting.  We made it back to KSC in one(ish) piece.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The R&D folks start disassembling your ship as soon as it lands.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding =  Quick, fire the engines back up before the R&D folks disassemble them! 
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = The R&D techs are concentrating so hard that they didn't even see us land.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = You would send your report out, but the R&D techs already disassembled the comms antenna.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = You hope the R&D folks were watching that landing.  Textbook perfect, if I do say so myself.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = The R&D folks are awestruck at the sight of your ship, having never seen one fully assembled before.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = We landed ON TOP of the building (you think). Now that is a pinpoint landing!
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = You hope the rocket exhaust doesn't catch whatever strange substance is in those tanks on fire.
		KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = You catch the complex on fire trying to counteract the wind with your rocket engines. Oh well, snack time!
		KerbinFlyingLowKSC = Woohoo! We're doin' it! Space b****es!!
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You look out the window and think that you can just make out KSC below.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You think that KSC may be somewhere below the clouds.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Almost back to KSC.  Just an atmosphere and a few thousand kilometers between us.
