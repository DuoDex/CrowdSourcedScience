		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You slowly inch your way away from the spacecraft, just to tell KSC you did, hoping that you don't get blown off the mountaintop by the winds.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = A little bit closer and you'll either be the first Kerbal on Mt. Keverest or a green stain on the side of the mountain.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Uhhhh...It's cold, windy, and we're really close to a mountain.  Why are we doing this EVA again?
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = It could be worse. You could be doing this over an active volcano.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The craggy mountains below look even closer now that there is no spaceship between you and them.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Is it just you or do those mountaintops seem...sharp? You want to go back inside now.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = You feel like you are in a dream just floating above the mountains below.  Hey, you ARE floating above the mountains below!
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = As you float outside your craft, you decide to count mountaintops to help pass the time.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The view of the mountains below is much clearer when you're not looking through the window of a spaceship.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you float peacefully high above the great mountains of Kerbin, you feel content in your choice of careers.
