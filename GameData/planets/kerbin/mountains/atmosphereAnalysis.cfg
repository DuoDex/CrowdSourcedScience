		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well. The goat one peak over is shivering.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The sensor tells you that you'll be gasping for breath soon after stepping out of your craft.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The atmospheric analysis reads "refreshing" in the cool mountain air. You couldn't agree more.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Strong mountain winds buffet your craft. The atmospheric sensor is beside itself with joy.
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The air here seems crisp and refreshing.  Now time for a refreshing snack!
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The air gets progressively thinner as your craft climbs higher.  You're happy you didn't have to do this experiment on your own two feet.
