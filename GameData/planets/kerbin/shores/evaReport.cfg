		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take some sand from the desert and compare it with beach sand. They're actually fairly different! 
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = A Girlbal approaches you with a problem. It seems she has too many seashells. You try to tell her that she should sell seashells on the sea shore but find it difficult to finish your sentence.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The wet consistency of beach sand makes excellent building material and you immediately set about building a small shrine to your glory.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You look at the inviting waves and realize that you forgot your swimsuit!
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Ew! Something just touched your foot. Oh wait, it's just seaweed.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = You hang on to the craft one-handed as you use your other hand to fight off a particularly persistent seagull.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = You wave at all the Kerbals on the beach below.  Surely this will make the news reports.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You are now too high to worry about seagulls and can devote all your to attention to hanging on for dear life.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Kinda cold and windy out here.  Not at all like being on the surface at the shores.  You wish you hadn't smeared sunscreen all over your EVA suit now.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You chuckle at the idea that you are blocking someone's sunlight as they try to tan themselves on the beach below.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = You are mesmerized by the glint of the sunshine off the waves below as you stare through the thin visor of your helmet.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = We're in space! Take that Kraken!  Who's laughing now, huh???
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The coldness of outer space is a sharp contrast to the warmth-filled memories of your time on Kerbin's shores.
