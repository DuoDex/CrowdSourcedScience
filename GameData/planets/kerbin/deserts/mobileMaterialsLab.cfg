		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Watching the dust swirl among the samples, you realize that you're going to have to spend a lot of time cleaning them up for the next mission.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The lab seems to be picking up some of the dry, dusty particles from the surface as you fly so close to the ground.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Your low-altitude flight is kicking up a lot of dust. That can't be good for the samples.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder if that half sandwich you left in the fridge at home is still there, as you write up yet another lab report.  When will the reports end and the sandwiches begin??
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You take your juice pack and pour it all over the samples to prepare them for the dry, dusty ordeal they are about to face. Mission Control sighs and tells you to use a different set of samples.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = LLLLAAAABBBB RRRREEEEPPPPOOOORRRRTTTT IIIINNNN SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE!!!! Ahem, yes, everything is nominal.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you open the doors of the material bay, you see tiny dust particles from the deserts of Kerbin float free. You wonder where they will eventually end up and hope the answer isn't 'in your sock'. 
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look down at the surface through the lab window as you process results from your latest experiment.  Kerbin looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You take your little ball of sand from Kerbin's desert and let it loose into outer space. You fondly imagine it growing up and one day becoming a mighty asteroid! Then you remember what asteroids tend to do to inhabited planets and desperately try to gather it back up.
