// Squad had a bunch of unused science logs for airless bodies, I've used them for InSpaceLow and created a few new ones for
// bodies with atmospheres. I wrote the rest to ensure that all bodies had an appropriate message.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The telemetry indicates that all systems are functioning nominally.
		
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You run a diagnostics check. All systems ready for launch.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You run the automated pre-flight check. All systems ready for takeoff.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The extremely low signal delay indicates the probe is in the immediate vicinity of the space center.
		KerbinSrfLanded = The telemetry indicates the probe has landed somewhere on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The doppler shift of the signal lets you roughly estimate the airspeed of the probe.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You start getting some interference on the signal as the probe passes through the ionosphere.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You notice some interesting interference patterns in the signal, the guys over at R&D might want to see this.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Lots of interference out here, we must be outside the magnetosphere.
