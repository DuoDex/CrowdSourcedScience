	%RESULTS
	{
		SunInSpaceLow = Despite the proximity of the giant glowing ball of plasma below you, the needle refuses to budge. I guess I need to get a little closer...
		SunInSpaceLow = You detect the slightest trace of an atmosphere as you draw near to Kerbol. Which is a good thing, if you detected any more than that you doubt that your ship would still be intact.
		
		MohoInSpaceLow = The barometer reading is too low to measure. This planet has no atmosphere. // Squad
		MohoInSpaceLow = Doesn't look like there's much of an atmosphere here.
		MohoSrfLanded = As the sun blasts the terrain, you detect a slight rise in pressure. Various surface compounds appear to have vaporized in the intense heat, but it's too ephemeral to be considered a real atmosphere.
		
		EveInSpaceLow = As imposing as that atmosphere looks, we still seem to be outside it.
		EveInSpaceLow = The barometer looks back at you. You're not seriously considering entering that atmosphere, are you?
		
		GillyInSpaceLow = Either the instruments are broken, or there is no atmosphere on this rock. // Squad
		GillyInSpaceLow = The barometer appears to be chuckling at you. You really didn't expect to find an atmosphere here, did you?
		GillySrfLanded = As the sun heats the giant asteroid, you see the needle move slightly above 0. Still no real atmosphere though.
		
		KerbinInSpaceLow = There seems to be a distinct lack of atmosphere up here...
		KerbinInSpaceLow = I guess space really is a vacuum, who knew?
		
		MunInSpaceLow = Just for kicks you measure the pressure here. Yep, no atmosphere. // Squad
		MunInSpaceLow = No atmosphere. I guess we won't be able to use parachutes for landing here...
		
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Should a giant ball of ice cream have an atmosphere? You're not sure, but you want to get a little closer just to make sure...
		MinmusInSpaceLow = No atmosphere here either. You're beginning to suspect that Kerbin having an atmosphere is an anomaly rather than the norm.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You were hoping to smell delicious mint, but the lack of air makes that difficult.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Drat, there's not enough air to host a low-g paper airplane contest.
		
		DunaInSpaceLow = Still no atmosphere. You wonder just how low you'll need to get to deploy those parachutes...
		DunInSpaceLow = You can see an atmosphere down there, but it doesn't come up quite this far...
		
		IkeInSpaceLow = There appears to be no atmosphere here. // Squad
		IkeInSpaceLow = Looking at the surface, you form a hypothesis. More craters = less atmosphere.
		IkeSrfLanded = Your hypothesis appears to be promising, still no atmosphere.
		
		DresInSpaceLow = This data point appears to further confirm your hypothesis that craters and atmospheres are inversely related.
		DresInSpaceLow = You didn't really expect to find an atmosphere here anyways.
		DresSrfLanded = Surprisingly, you detect tiny bursts of pressure as the sun heats the ground and vaporizes some frozen gasses. Not enough to count as an atmosphere, but at least it's something.
		DresSrfLanded = Yep, no atmosphere here.
		
		JoolInSpaceLow = As massive as Jool is, it's atmosphere is still finite. It's still a vacuum here.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The barometer appears to be trying to escape. It REALLY doesn't want to measure that atmosphere.
		
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The atmosphere here doesn't extend out nearly as far as Kerbin's.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The barometer appears to be excited in anticipation of entering this atmosphere. Unfortunately you're still in space so it will need to wait a little longer.
		
		VallInSpaceLow = There does not appear to be any atmosphere to sample. // Squad
		VallInSpaceLow = The barometer beeps, indicating a nonzero reading. You look out and see that you've just flown through the plume of a cryovolcano. As you look back, the reading is back to zero again.
		VallSrfLanded = The barometer beeps occasionally as gas vents from the surface.
		
		TyloInSpaceLow = Surprisingly, you discover no traces of atmosphere. // Squad
		TyloInSpaceLow = What is such a massive moon doing without air?
		TyloSrfLanded = Still nothing. You anticipate many theses will be written on why Tylo has no atmosphere.
		
		BopInSpaceLow = It's a giant space rock, what did you expect to find? // Squad
		BopInSpaceLow = Rocky moons like this don't usually have atmospheres. The current barometer reading appears to confirm your intuition.
		BopInSpaceLow = Once again, your intuition is correct. No atmosphere.
		
		PolInSpaceLow = Nothing to report here. // Squad
		PolInSpaceLow = Yet another airless rock.
		PolSrfLanded = Good thing there's no air here, you forgot to bring your allergy medicine.
		
		EelooInSpaceLow = The instrument can't register any pressure here. // Squad
		EelooInSpaceLow = With all the cracks in the crust, you were certain that there would at least be something to measure, but there's nothing.
		EelooSrfLanded = As the weak rays of the sun raise the temperature slightly farther away from absolute zero, you see a slight increase in pressure as gasses that should never exist as a solid are finally freed from the surface.
		
		InSpace = As expected, no atmosphere here.
