	RESULTS
	{
		default = The crew is loving the feeling of weightlessness.
		KerbinInSpace = Playing darts in space does not work.
		MunInSpace = Kerbals still hate brushing their teeth, even in micro-gravity.
		MinmusInSpace = Consuming food is considerably more difficult in space.
		GillyInSpace = Snacks are more appreciated in the weightlessness of space.
		MohoInSpace = The experiment seems to react violently to the micro-gravity environment.
		EveInSpace = Plants grow far quicker in space.
		DunaInSpace = In the reduced gravity, the sapling has started to grow an eye and tentacles.
		IkeInSpace = Exercise is important for the health of spacebound Kerbals.
		DresInSpace = The test subject blinks more quickly in this environment.
		JoolInSpace = The subject is mysteriously pulled to the side of the container.
		LaytheInSpace = The crew seems to do its tasks better. What causes this is unknown.
		VallInSpace = The moon's resonance with Jool is throwing off the results.
		TyloInSpace = Performing science experiments is more pleasurable in this gravitational field.
		BopInSpace = The plants in the cabin are pointing to the moon's pole.
		PolInSpace = The subject's hairs are standing up straight for some reason.
		EelooInSpace = The crew is too homesick to do any experiments, which is interesting in itself.
