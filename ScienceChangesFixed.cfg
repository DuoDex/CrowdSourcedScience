		default = You hear a loud thud on the hull of the spacecraft. You look intently at your gauges and readings and confirm there is no serious damage to the space craft.
		default = You report that you could use more fuel and space on the spacecraft. You begin to contemplate why they call it a Spacecraft when there is hardly any space in here. It’s more like a sardine can.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder why you experienced over 3 gs when the rocket was moved to the pad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Just a heads’ up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Are we there yet?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = “Wait! Let me out, I changed my mind!”
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Check ignition and may Von Kerman’s love be with you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder what that nasty smell is. Either there is a serious propellant leak or Bob had burritos for lunch. Again.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you’re in space.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You think that you should be flying the craft instead of making boring logs.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You take a piece of paper from your notepad and draw a spaceplane on it.

		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = “Clear Right. Clear Left. We’re good here. Ground control come in. Over.”
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Reporting from the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of traffic, because I don't think we ever got the clearance to be here.

		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay, just hallucinating.
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The mountains rise up from the grasslands of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from up here.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look out the window hoping to find a tasty cake until you realize somebody made a slight spelling error in the flight plan.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look around and see no water for miles. You begin to wonder why you didn’t bring more.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You wonder if crashing here would create a glass crater. Then you realize how cool that would be.

		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Moose!
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Please don’t land here, please don’t land here, please don’t land here...

		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You wonder if it’s safe to drink the water.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = The water looks so peaceful from here.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = You imagine all the wonderful creatures that live below the surface that would probably eat you. Or at least brush up against your leg while swimming.
		KerbinInSpace = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpace = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.

		KerbinInSpace = Agoraphobia sets in...
		KerbinInSpace = Bound for the stars.
		KerbinInSpace = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your vehicle they had once held in place.
		KerbinInSpace = Your slide rule breaks, and you begin to search for your backup before realizing that you don't know how to use a slide rule anyway.
		KerbinInSpace = You're in space and not dead. The crew and Flight Control have agreed that it's indeed a big step forward.
		KerbinInSpace = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
		KerbinInSpace = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
		KerbinInSpace = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
		KerbinInSpace = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.
		KerbinInSpace = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to microgravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
		KerbinInSpace = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like my globe!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Hey, I can see Jeb's Ego from here!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!"

		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.

		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in, from space!”
		KerbinInSpace = This is why we need fancy suits, huh?

		KerbinInSpace = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there’s nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpace = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
		KerbinInSpace = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
		KerbinInSpace = Let’s engage Warp Drive… wait, we don’t have Warp Drive?
		KerbinInSpace = Everything looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here.”

		KerbinInSpace = It’s time to leave the capsule... right?
		KerbinInSpace = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out -- maybe ankle-deep -- and the water seems inviting.
		Mun = You see a great sphere of mouldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the Mün.
		Mun = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.
		MunInSpace = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
		MunInSpace = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
		MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.

		MunInSpace = Wasn’t there an opera written about this once?
		MunInSpace = You don’t know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be… interesting.

		MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
		MunInSpaceHigh = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal’s.
		Minmus = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...
		MinmusInSpace = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if it’s possible to EVA to the surface and back.
		MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
		MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface…
		MinmusInSpace = Well, it’s certainly much smaller in person.
		MinmusInSpace = Jetpacking down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
		MinmusInSpace = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.
		GillyInSpace = Yup. It's tiny.
		GillyInSpace = A rock so little must have very little gravity. Next time, you'll bring a golf club.
		GillyInSpace = How cute! Despite its potato-like appearance, Gilly is an adorable little asteroid.
		GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. You bet you could jetpack down there.
		GillyInSpace = “I didn’t know they made them this small.”
		GillyInSpace = You wonder if anything would have a TWR of less than one here.
		GillyInSpace = What is this, a moon for ants?
		GillyInSpace = This place looks a bit boring. You start calculating what it would take to deorbit it into Eve, until your calculator gives you a NaN error. Flight Control refuses to do calculations for you.
		GillyInSpace = In retrospect, you imagined it to be bigger.
		GillyInSpace = It looks small and not very tasty.
		GillyInSpace = It looks like a potato. You are starting to feel very hungry.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You look down to the surface. It's so close! Of course you don't want to end up lithobraking on those hills by accident, but at this speed it probably wouldn't be that bad.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You think you can stick your arm out and touch the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but you are afraid that your first step will launch you right off the surface.

		GillySrfLanded = You feel no change in gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = You feel a surge in gravity. Mentioning nothing to KSC, you put on your brown pants.
		Moho = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.
		MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
		MohoInSpace = You ponder the mystery of where Moho’s atmosphere went. You’re glad it doesn’t have one anymore, because that would make coming back really hard.
		MohoInSpace = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
		MohoSrfLanded = It appears the heat shielding is melting. The Kerbals are sweating and hot.
		MohoSrfLanded = The crew considers which snacks would taste best if cooked.

		Eve = What smells like purple?
		Eve = That is definitely a deep commitment to purple.

		EveSrfSplashed = Vile lakes shimmer beneath the crushing atmosphere.
		EveSrfSplashed = This reminds you of a time you saw a man get trapped in a vat of grape soda. Unfortunately, you can't drink your way out of this one.
		EveSrfSplashed = After looking through the window, you inform mission control you figured out where all the grape soda from the break room fridge keeps going.
		EveSrfSplashed = A couple mission controllers assure you that's grape juice outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins peeling the paint off the ship.
		EveSrfSplashed = You're pretty sure this *isn't* grape juice.
		EveSrfSplashed = We’re bouncing a bit too much here.
		EveSrfSplashed = The ocean is feeling a bit too cold…
		EveSrfSplashed = Short circuit in Wire Five!
		DunaInSpace = The planet looks very orange, which reminds you of the orange chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?
		DunaInSpace = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
		DunaInSpace = As you orbit the planet, you pick up what appears to be a TV signal from Kerbin. It's so badly distorted that you can't make neither head nor tail of it.
		DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.

		DresInSpace = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
		DresInSpace = Looking down you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep. Too bad there’s no atmosphere, because you’d like to parachute down there.
		DresInSpace = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
		DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown, with a few craters.
		DresInSpaceLow = It's very grey and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better grey-resistant landing legs.
		DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
		DresSrfLanded = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mün. Wait.
		DresSrfLanded = It is exactly as grey and icy as expected. Not a bit of grey less, not a bit of ice more.
		DresSrfLanded = You were right… it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.
		Jool = We're very far from home.
		JoolInSpace = Captain's log: we are out of snacks.
		JoolInSpace = As you look down upon the great green planet, you think you can see a stirring of the clouds far, far below.
		JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below. They seem to go on forever, endlessly swirling into each other.
		JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color. More planets should be this color.
		JoolInSpace = You wonder if orange juice here is green.
		JoolInSpace = You see three big moons and two little ones. You want to land on them all.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The green colour of the atmosphere reminds you of the soft grass of Kerbin. Sort of.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You note just how big Jool is, and try not to think about how small it makes you feel.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The massive size of the Van Allen radiation belts is ripping electrons from the ship's hull. You carefully avoid the walls, lest you be zapped with the mother of all static discharges.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Maybe you'd be able to get a sample of metallic hydrogen before the inevitable crunch?
		JoolInSpaceLow = The green orb is looking very big now.
		JoolFlyingHigh = While observing from the window you get startled as the Jool seems to look back at you! After a moment of confusion you find out that it was your face reflecting from the window and comment on the screams to have been "only radio chatter."
		JoolFlyingHigh = As the craft flies through the dense green clouds, it slows down dramatically. Just don't get stuck.
		JoolFlyingHigh = It's more than disconcerting to see clouds in all directions.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You see a massive lightning bolt in the far off clouds. You nervously ask Mission Control if the ship is rated for that kind of discharge.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The planet before you resembles nothing so much as a giant tennis ball. Perhaps it has fuzz that can be harvested to build a space elevator?
		JoolFlyingHigh = You look out the window and are amazed by the view.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You wonder if you will live to see the next hour.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You hope the aerobrake won’t be an aero landing.

		LaytheInSpace = As the crew look down upon Laythe, they are reminded of home and the huge distance they have traveled.
		LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin. You wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
		LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You note the landmasses in your report.
		LaytheSrfLanded = After hearing the air is breathable, you open your space helmet, only to find that breathable does not mean odorless or pleasant.
		LaytheSrfLanded = One day we will have a permanent base here. One day.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The crew deliberates heavily on the correct way to pronounce 'Laythe'.
		LaytheSrfLanded = It appears that we are very much on the ground right now.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.

		VallInSpace = You wonder why this moon’s inclination is exactly the same as Laythe’s.
		TyloInSpace = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
		TyloInSpace = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
		TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered than the other.
		TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there...
		TyloInSpace = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesn’t have an atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity is quite heavy and reminds you of home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You can't walk a few meters without your face becoming friends with the surface. It is a little agitating.
		TyloSrfLanded = I was expecting a bounce in my step. Maybe my springs aren't working.
		TyloSrfLanded = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.
		TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.
		BopInSpace = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
		BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
		BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
		BopInSpace = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because you’ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
		BopInSpace = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can’t help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
		BopInSpace = Stuck in an eccentric, inclined orbit, this rock offers nothing to look at. A complete waste of time.
		BopInSpace = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
		BopInSpace = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it’s hiding some dark secret...
		BopSrfLanded = You're not sure why, but this place gives you an eerie feeling.
		BopSrfLanded = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.
		BopSrfLanded = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.

		BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.
		PolInSpace = Turns out Pol is real, and not just a speck of pollen on the lens of Galileo Kerman's telescope. Who knew?

		PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
		PolInSpace = Just looking at the surface makes you sneeze.
		PolSrfLanded = You wonder if you can bring back some pol for your garden on Kerbin.
		PolSrfLanded = You are happy that landing is over.
		PolSrfLanded = The crew has been reduced to excessive sneezing.
		Eeloo = As you stare down at the splintered, lifeless surface, a question forms in your mind: "Was this really worth it?"
		EelooInSpace = The crew look out towards the frozen ice ball Eeloo, and are momentarily lost for words. Few of Kerbalkind have made it this far from home, and the courage, determination, and drive their species has to put them here dawns on everyone. Their thoughts are profound and humble, that so few are supported by so many.
		EelooInSpace = It reminds you of a snowball. Is it winter already?
		EelooInSpace = Now this is an icy planet. You start imagining epic snowball fights in microgravity.
		EelooInSpace = You note that the capsule is not equipped with central heating, and Mission Control informs you this is because you were meant to go to Moho. This does not instill you with confidence.
		EelooInSpace = It looks like a great big spherical ice cube!
		EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other planets nearby. You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe you should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
		EelooInSpace = For a moment, you can't quite remember which star is your sun.
		EelooInSpace = I feel like we could go anywhere. Let’s go. Like, now. Really, anywhere.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look out of the capsule and can't find Kerbin. What has mission control gotten you into this time?
		EelooSrfLanded = From this far away, the radio seems to be a bit patchy. You can hear static blocking out your next instructions. Oh well, it probably wasn't important anyway.
		EelooSrfLanded = You take notes on how barren and lonely Eeloo is. You then try to calculate how long it will take for the signal to get to and from Kerbin.
		EelooSrfLanded = It seems you have eaten all of your snacks. You start weeping quietly in the corner.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what's beneath the ice...
		EelooSrfLanded = You look out the windows and see ice. Lots and lots of ice. And some rocks here and there. Icy rocks.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder about the ship that got you here. Are you really sure you can get back?

		EelooSrfLanded = You feel cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel very cold.

		VallSrfLanded = You can't wait to go outside. It looks so beautiful!
		VallSrfLanded = Everything in the ship just bounced, that was one heck of a quake!
		VallSrfLanded = Quakes rattle tools and loose gear every few minutes.
		JoolFlyingLow = You can feel the green all around you now. This is awesome.
		JoolFlyingLow = This seems like a situation Jebediah would like to be in, just with more SRBs and explosions.
		JoolFlyingLow = As you look up through the stormy green clouds, it strikes you that maybe flying that low in Jool's atmosphere wasn't such a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = The craft is shaking and feels very unstable.
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize you are not a probe.
		JoolFlyingLow = Your aerobraking attempt has turned into an aero landing. Was this part of the plan?

		JoolFlyingLow = You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
		JoolFlyingLow = Landing on Jool, eh? Why not?
		JoolFlyingLow = Still no sign of a surface. Perhaps if you flew even lower?
		MunFlyingHigh = You wonder if you'll be able to order pizza from here.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = The orbit of Eeloo being so odd, you begin to ponder the existence of a planet beyond it. You think a good name for this planet would be "Planet Y".
		EelooInSpaceHigh = You look out the window and notice beige stripes and spots on the surface. You immediately wonder if it's cookie dough.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo looks very white; maybe someone covered it in a giant bedsheet?
		DunaFlyingHigh = You look out, and note the massive geological features. It is possible that Duna was once very geologically active.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Very small piles of fine grain red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingHigh = There seems to be something resembling a face on the surface of a planet, but it's only a play of light and shadow.

		PolInSpaceHigh = You wipe off the window to make sure that speck you see is not a piece of pollen.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = You ask Mission Control what you're doing here.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Somehow your foot has become stuck in the controls. Who has been chewing gum?

		LaytheSrfSplashed = You suddenly realize that you forgot to bring your towel.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Looking at the map of Laythe to figure out which of the islands is the closest, you know it'll be a long swim for any chance of rescue.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As you look out the window, you see something glowing below you. You decide it's probably best to get to shore as soon as possible.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's surface seems to be covered with dunes. You remark that the planet was aptly-named.
		DunaSrfLanded = "It's extremely red; over."
		DunaSrfLanded = Dark spots on the surface of Duna were once thought to be the darkness of vegetation growing near the poles as the seasons change. It is now known that the dark coloration is in fact caused by seasonal dust storms.
		DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You notice you are coming in close to the red planet, and you secretly hope to find intelligent life!

		EveFlyingHigh = After various tests you can confirm that it is indeed "very purple".
		EveFlyingHigh = The wind and crew are screaming.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It feels strangely dangerous out there. Mission control insists it's safe, but you don't think they would know very well.

		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Well, it looks no different from here than it did from far away.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The ground here is completely flat. It's really boring.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = You note that your radio fails to transmit when set to the OFF position.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = At this distance, Kerbin is little more than a pale blue dot, floating the the inky vastness of space.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = Seeing the dark canyon makes you wonder what wonders lie down there.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to have blocked most of Jool's radiation at this altitude. You hope your tan doesn't suffer as a result.

		EveSrfLanded = You start to think that it’s entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn’t hurt to taste it… right?

		GillySrfLanded = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.
		GillySrfLanded = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = You balance yourself on your pinky finger and start doing pushups, only to find yourself slowly floating away.

		SunInSpaceHigh = You look out into the universe and wonder if you're alone, if Kerbin is a cradle of life in an otherwise sterile universe. Mission Control tells you to stop thinking so much.
		SunInSpaceHigh = It would have been better if it was green.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You feel kind of small right now... you hope you know where you're going.
		SunInSpaceHigh = You search in every direction, but there is no kraken to be seen.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Suddenly you hear a deep growling. Is that the space kraken?
		SunInSpaceHigh = Staring into the void, you ponder your place in the universe.
		SunInSpaceLow = You release a gray rock from your space suit pocket and make a resolution to come back in a year to find out if it looks like Moho.

		KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there’s nothing you can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It’s so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.

		IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
		IkeSrfLanded = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
		IkeSrfLanded = You look up at the sky and see something zip past...
		IkeSrfLanded = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface. The surface appears to react oddly to light.

		DresSrfLanded = When you look closely at the ground, you can see many different types of deposits mixed together.
		DresSrfLanded = You feel like a few smaller rocks should be visible in the distance. However, when you look up, you spot nothing of the sort.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You feel your skin burn as you leave the vessel. It would be a good idea to get back on board!
		JoolFlyingHigh = You find that the outside pressures are equal with your suit's interior pressure. Removing your helmet would still be a rather poor idea.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Feeling insignificant near the towering mass of the gas giant, you are inclined to think that size matters after all.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.

		LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet’s protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it’s because of lower oxygen content.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air looks tolerable and the water looks very inviting. A beautiful place to be!
		LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The low land to water ratio and sedate water cycle of Laythe combine to give its oceans low salinity. You're forced to constantly swim to keep afloat.

		LaytheSrfSplashed = You realise that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = As much as you'd like to find life, the only green wiggling creature here is in a spacesuit.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.

		VallSrfLanded = Ice melts down and evaporates from the friction of your space boots. You concentrate very hard on keeping your balance.
		VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think maybe the underground ocean the scientists predicted is not that far below.
		TyloSrfLanded = Is it me, or did my spacesuit just get really heavy?
		TyloSrfLanded = You try jumping... It isn't very effective
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and reminds you of home. The lack of atmosphere, however, provides a stark contrast.
		TyloSrfLanded = You look around, trying to decide if the nerve-wracking descent was worth it. How are you going to get back?
		TyloSrfLanded = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = If surface composition is of any indication, there is a distinct possibility of finding underground lakes and caverns somewhere around.
		TyloSrfLanded = They say the gravity of Tylo adds five pounds.
		BopSrfLanded = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.
		BopSrfLanded = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.
		BopSrfLanded = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
		BopSrfLanded = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it’s probably just your suit being out of order.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there’s something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.

		EelooSrfLanded = You're standing on a giant dirty snowball.
		EelooSrfLanded = As you think about the distance and time it took to get you here, a sudden shiver runs down your spine.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what made you believe all the cheery people that assured you time and again that you were coming back.
		EelooSrfLanded = Even through the padding of your spacesuit, there's a distinct chill out here.
		EelooSrfLanded = The sun looks so distant now, compared to home...
		EelooSrfLanded = You step off the capsule to the crackling of ice under your boots. Your eyes adjust to the faint light. From way out here, Kerbol is just another star. You reflect upon the several year journey it took to get here.

		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Oh dear.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = "Why did I go outside? I really want to get back into the capsule!"
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You suddenly realize that your space suit doesn't include a parachute.
		JoolFlyingLow = I think I just heard something crack in my helmet. Can I go home?
		JoolFlyingLow = You are advised to get back into the capsule, fast.
		JoolFlyingLow = I should have taken a green space suit for camouflage.
		JoolFlyingLow = You feel a sudden urge to see what would happen if you landed on a gas giant.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You feel compelled to stare at the sky.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to have gone very far... yet.

		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You spot a narrow part of the canyon, and wonder if you could make the jump across.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = There are visible striations in the walls of the canyons.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there.

		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.

		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Dirt, dust, and burnt flecks of steel make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Looks like… dirt. And rocks. And more dirt. Why are you out here again?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your metal detector beeps and whizzes a bit. After careful digging, you find part of the engine from Jeb’s pickup truck. How it got there you don’t know, but you do know why Jeb’s truck isn’t in the parking lot today.

		MunSrfLanded = Oddly enough, the sample smells similar to swiss cheese. One wonders if it's edible.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.

		MunSrfLanded = You note the sample's lack of cheese.
		MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a greyish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.

		MunSrfLanded = Through extensive and professional testing, you find out that, contrary to popular belief, the Mun is not made of cheese. Also, you immediately regret your testing.
		MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The ground appears to be made of very small, sharp, abrasive pieces of grey rock. It would probably be best if you didn't rub your space suit against the stuff.

		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured here.

		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.

		MinmusSrfLanded = You sneak a taste of the surface sample... nope, it definitely is not made of delicious dessert products.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Surface samples confirm that it is not made out of mint, even though it looks and tastes like it.
		Eve = Oooooo. Purple!
		EveSrfLanded = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this colour falls as precipitation.
		EveSrfLanded = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it worth it? Sure! It's purple!
		EveSrfLanded = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.
		EveSrfLanded = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?

		EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
		EveSrfLanded = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it just reflecting that color from its surroundings? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.

		EveSrfLandedMountains = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
		DresInSpace = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples. Probably a micro-meteor or some swamp gas. You had nothing to do with it.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = The metal is metallic, the wood is wooden, the glass is glassy. If Tylo is going change any of this you will have to get closer.

		MunFlyingLow = Just for kicks you measure the pressure here. Yep, no atmosphere.
		MunSrfLanded = The pressure gauge is sitting there motionless. Perhaps you should tap it a few times to be sure?

		DunaSrfLanded = There isn’t much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
		IkeFlyingLow = There appears to be no atmosphere here.

		IkeSrfLanded = The gauge reads nothing, even on the surface.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere. But there are very few moons with atmospheres, so what did you expect?
		JoolFlyingLow = You notice the barometer has a crack in it shaped like a doughnut. There's also a reading about the pressure, but you've stopped caring.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer's hand switched from "You sure we're in an atmosphere and not underwater?" to "Look, I wasn't built to record pressures in kbar". It suddenly dawns on you that you might have aerobraked a bit too deep.
		JoolFlyingLow = The sensor starts breaking under pressure.
		JoolFlyingLow = The immense pressure causes the sensor to implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = Pressure increases quite rapidly, then stabilises on "-65535". It occurs to you that barometer may be broken.

		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is very dense. The glass components appear to be weakening. Let's blame the engineers if anything breaks!
		JoolFlyingHigh = The pressure here is very high. It seems dangerous to probe any deeper.

		VallFlyingLow = There does not appear to be any atmosphere to sample.
		VallSrfLanded = Gases rising from the planet occasionally register slight pressures. That, or the instrument is on the fritz.

		TyloFlyingLow = Surprisingly, you discover no traces of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = The vacuum seems a little bit thicker here.
		TyloSrfLanded = There is no detectable atmospheric pressure here. Fascinating!
		TyloSrfLanded = Why such a massive body acquired no atmosphere is a complete mystery to you.

		BopSrfLanded = Instruments again support the theory that asteroids are too small to have an atmosphere.
		PolFlyingLow = Nothing to report here.
		PolSrfLanded = No atmospheric pressure is detectable on Pol.
		EelooFlyingLow = The instrument doesn't register any pressure here.
		EelooSrfLanded = The air here, besides being absent, is also very lonely.
		EelooSrfLanded = Beep... beep... beep... boop. The instrument has frozen up.
		EelooSrfLanded = The indicator shifts back and forth, then finally settles on zero.
		EelooSrfLanded = No trace of an atmosphere. In this intense cold, most gases would have frozen and precipitated to the surface.
		DresSrfLanded = If there is an atmosphere, it's way too thin for the barometer to detect. Such a disappointment.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You contemplate dunking the scanner to see if it can measure depth, but mission control says that will void the warranty.

		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.

		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.

		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = There's air here, but not much of it.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.

		LaytheSrfSplashed = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments. Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.

		MinmusSrfLanded = The gravity readings dash your hopes - based on its size, Minmus is far too dense to be made of ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sensor takes detailed readings of the local gravity on Minmus.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The scan picks up the subtle changes in field caused by the orbit of the Mun. This data will provide valuable insight into the local system.

		DunaSrfLanded = The sensor performs a detailed and calibrated sweep of local gravity on Duna.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sensor is able to record the effects of Ike as it orbits Duna.
		IkeInSpace = The sensor verifies that Duna and Ike are tidally locked.

		DresSrfLanded = The sensor measures the local gravity in fine detail and records all variations.
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor is on the fritz again.
		MohoSrfLanded = The gravitational pull of this planet is high for one of its size. The core must be extremely dense.

		LaytheSrfLanded = There does appear to be some gravity here.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You detect massive fluctuations as Jool tugs on the moon's surface.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The Sensor scans the local gravity of Laythe. Jool’s influence is notable.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sensor provides detailed gravity information related to the tides.
		VallInSpace = Scanning from orbit provides a clearer picture of the internal makeup of Vall.

		TyloSrfLanded = Confirmed: getting home will not be easy.
		TyloSrfLanded =Detailed scans hint at hollow spaces in the interior of the planet.

		BopInSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
		BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here…
		BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location… wait, it’s gone now.
		PolInSpace = The sensor picks up multiple layers under the surface of the planet.
		PolSrfLanded = There are roughly twice as many left-handed negative graviolis as right-handed ones here. That means something. Nobody knows what, though.
		PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol.
		EelooInSpace = Before you left Kerbin, the program director told you of the great gravity of your mission. It is clear to you now that he exaggerated.
		EelooInSpace = Though the surface appears to be smooth, there are fluctuations coming from beneath it.
		EelooSrfLanded = This planetoid has a small but significant gravitational force, perfect for extreme snowball fights.
		EelooSrfLanded = Gravity scans are very clear here. There is little influence from other bodies.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity scanner reports a low reading, very similar to that of the Mun. Do all moons have the same gravity? R&D notes the theory down, but they use a pencil just in case.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity is very low!
		IkeSrfLanded = You detect fluctuations in Duna’s tidal effect as it librates in the distance.
		SunInSpaceLow = The gravitational pull is very high. Maybe that's why the planets don't fly away?
		SunInSpaceLow = The manufacturer's manual for this instrument has classified readings in this range as "very unwise". There is a somewhat unhelpful footnote that the warranty does not cover melting.
		SunInSpaceLow = The readings are so far off the scale that the dial loops back around to 1.
		EveFlyingLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.

		BopSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
		MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.
		MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.

	{
		default = You look at the results and understand that you have no idea what these numbers mean.
		default = A note is taped to the side of the instrument: "Does not measure fear."
		default = The sensors detect trace amounts of the installing technician's sandwich.
		default = You run an Atmosphere Analysis, recording various measurements like temperature, pressure, and atmosphere composition.
		default = You’d like to run an atmospheric analysis, but all you can smell is the cheese from your snack last night. So you just push buttons and hope something valuable, or cheesy, will come of it.
		default = Aaron Kerman was best known for his heroic final efforts in discovering that the Mun has no atmosphere. Now we use these sensors instead.
		Mun = After a brief analysis you conclude that the lack of data is very likely related to the local atmosphere's void-like composition.
		default = Yep. Works as specified.
		MohoSrfLanded = There appears to be no atmosphere here. However, there are trace elements being detected close to the surface.
		MohoSrfLanded = Having expected a thin, melting-hot atmosphere around Moho, you can’t help but wonder what those pesky science fiction writers were thinking.
		MohoSrfLanded = Nary a breeze.
		EveSrfLanded = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
		EveSrfLanded = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
		EveSrfLanded = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.
		EveSrfLanded = Though this is an atmosphere, it's definitely not something you want to breathe.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
		EveSrfLanded = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.
		EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird colour.
		EveFlyingHigh = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Mission controls insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.

		EveFlyingHigh = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.
		EveFlyingHigh = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.
		EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of superheated water vapor.
		GillySrfLanded = You make several analyzes and expect different results each time. Nope, still no atmosphere.
		GillySrfLanded = There is no detectable atmosphere.

		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you’d expect from a thriving space program.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid, and seems to have a bit of a fishy smell to it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.

		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Sensors indicate a sudden decrease in ambient temperature and an increase in surrounding density.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You tap the sensor a few times, but it only spits sparks. Somebody should’ve told you it could only analyze air.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There’s lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There’s a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well. The goat one peak over is shivering
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito divebombing it. Apparently it’s carrying mal aria.

		MunSrfLanded = You didn't even stop to think about the lack of atmosphere here before installing this sensor did you?
		MunSrfLanded = The analysis shows not even a trace of air. You decide to see how long you can hold your breath, just in case.

		Duna = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
		DunaSrfLanded = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaSrfLanded = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
		DunaSrfLanded = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer say the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
		DunaSrfLanded = The carbon dioxide in the air is thick enough that it could be harvested for plants in greenhouses. Wait, what?
		DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.

		DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be a larger concentration of heavy isotopes in the atmosphere than on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLanded = 255. Definitely 255.
		IkeSrfLanded = Either there's no atmosphere or the sensor is broken. Better not take your helmets off here, just in case.
		IkeSrfLanded = You run an analysis on the non-existent atmosphere.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is a faint aura of particles just like that of the Mün, but it can’t be called an atmosphere.

		DresSrfLanded = There does not appear to be an atmosphere here.
		DresSrfLanded = It’s an airless world.
		DresSrfLanded = The scan reveals an atmosphere just like Kerbin’s... then you find a tiny hole above the scanner. Well, some bubble gum should fix that.

		JoolFlyingHigh = The sensors detect high concentrations of chlorine and helium. You are fascinated, but suspect your findings will cause some headaches for planetary scientists back on Kerbin.

		JoolFlyingLow = It's so incredibly dense.
		JoolFlyingLow = Engineers scramble to adjust calculations to account for the new, very large crack in the instrument casing.
		JoolFlyingLow = The drag and pressure almost shut down the science machinery. The main report reads "Pressure Warning: Gain altitude immediately."
		JoolFlyingLow = The computer running the atmosphere analysis tool crashed. That's probably not good. Upon return, you plan to have a word with the engineers who designed this computer.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere here is made of little but hydrogen and helium.
		JoolFlyingLow = "Do you smell that? That smelly smell... it smells... smelly..."
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be very thick here.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere is getting much denser now. However, it appears to be unusually transparent.
		JoolFlyingLow = Don't be silly.

		JoolFlyingLow = The instrument is having trouble sampling at these densities.
		JoolFlyingLow = The instrument housing is starting to buckle under the immense pressure.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!
		LaytheSrfLanded = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. You shouldn't volunteer to go out first without a helmet on however.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Breathing this probably wouldn’t kill you... immediately.

		EelooSrfLanded = The only atmosphere here seems to be lying around in frozen lumps.
		EelooSrfLanded = A lot of energy was expended to bring an atmospheric package all the way out here for nothing.
		EelooSrfLanded = The dust from landing is tricking the sensor into thinking there's an atmosphere here.
		DunaFlyingLow = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
		DunaFlyingLow = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingLow = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into… *ahem.*
		DunaFlyingLow = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
		DunaFlyingLow = Much of the atmosphere is dust that's blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
		EveFlyingLow = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.
		EveFlyingLow = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?
		EveFlyingLow = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!
		EveFlyingLow = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingLow = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.
		EveFlyingLow = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor.

		LaytheFlyingLow = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photodissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
		LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.
		EelooInSpace = If there is an atmosphere, it's almost undetectable -- likely from the cryogenic volcanoes spewing stuff everywhere.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
		MunInSpaceLow = Despite what some say, the Mun does not feature an atmosphere.
		SunInSpaceLow = Kerbol is emitting mostly helium and hydrogen, with trace elements occasionally blipping the screen. Perhaps a party supply store or blimp company would want to mine it?
		DunaFlyingHigh = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
