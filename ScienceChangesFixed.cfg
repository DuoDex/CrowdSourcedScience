	              default = You find a kettle in the supplies container and start to beg mission control the permission to stop what you are doing and have a cup of tea.
                default = The vastness of space is mind-boggling. It's crazy how many puddings could be stored with the advent of high-capacity dessert storage devices.
                default = "My leg is so itchy. And why does my suit smell like anchovies... Wait a minute... Are we recording?!"

                default = Nothing of great importance has happened just now.
                default = You hear a loud thud on the hull of the spacecraft. You look intently at your gauges and readings and confirm there is no serious damage to the space craft.
                default = You report that you could use more fuel and space on the spacecraft. You begin to contemplate why they call it a Spacecraft when there is hardly any space in here. It’s more like a sardine can.

                default = You are sick and tired of filling out these stupid crew reports.
                default = Yup, we’re in a pod.        
                    default = There’s something mystical about the emptiness of space. 
                default = Hmm? Wha? Oh, the report!

                default = You begin a rendition of “Space Oddity.”
                default = Mission Control asks your position. You tell them you’re sitting down facing front, and ask why they’d want to know that.
                default = You realise that most of these reports are horrible. 
                default = When you gotta go, you gotta go. Who forgot to bring toilet paper? 
                SunInSpaceLow = You wonder if you could fry an egg here.
                SunInSpaceLow = You are almost more amazed that you got here than at the fact that you haven't melted yet.

                SunInSpaceLow = As the craft gets closer to Kerbol, you start to feel the effects of the heat on the craft.  You break out the extra water, and make a note.
                SunInSpaceLow = You ask Mission Control why they put you so close to Kerbol. They respond, "Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT." You can only wonder what that's supposed to mean.

                SunInSpaceLow = Theories predict that, at this distance, neutrino radiation is so high that you might even detect a collision.
                SunInSpaceLow = You feel nervous as the sun's radiation blasts the windows. It's like a hand reaching out towards your spacecraft...

                SunInSpaceHigh = You are bored, as nothing of interest is happening.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You press your face against the window and gaze at the wonders of space....only to be cut off by mission control reminding you to write a report.  
                SunInSpaceHigh = You close your eyes.  That seems to be the only way to make the sun disappear.

                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Just a heads’ up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.

                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you’re in space.

                KerbinInSpace = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.
                KerbinInSpace = Planet Kerbin is so blue and there is nothing you can do.
                KerbinInSpace = You wonder at the fact that Kerbin is mostly green.
                KerbinInSpace = You stare out the window in deep thought, pondering the answer to the ultimate question, before being rudely interrupted by the Mission Control.

                KerbinInSpace = Bound for the stars.
                KerbinInSpace = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your vehicle they had once held in place.

                KerbinInSpace = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
                KerbinInSpace = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
                KerbinInSpace = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.
                KerbinInSpace = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to microgravity.  You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
                KerbinInSpace = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like my globe!
                KerbinInSpaceLow = "Hey, I can see Jeb's Ego from here!"
                KerbinInSpaceLow = "TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!"
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You feel dizzy, unable to keep your head from spinning. If you are going to build a larger crew pod, a web of ropes inside might be of help.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You are chatting to mission control when your radio channel is interrupted by some guy named Major Tom frantically saying something has gone wrong. You tell him take a protein pill and put his helmet on.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You kill some time chatting with a random ham radio operator.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = The command console reads "Welcome to space. Please enjoy your stay."

                KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky is mostly below us.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = You are almost in an orbit with your home planet.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Maybe if you get out and push?
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Just a little bit further to go!
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Bail out!
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Don’t bail out!
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Do we have enough fuel to make it into real space?
                KerbinInSpaceLow = If you rotate the craft, we might end up aerobraking…
                KerbinInSpaceLow = As you gaze down on your home planet, you are simultaneously filled with wonder and amazed that you made it this far without exploding.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Here you are sitting in a tin can, far above the world.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = “Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”

                KerbinInSpace = After rigorous testing, the crew has determined that microgravity increases the fun of bouncy balls by 200%.
                KerbinInSpace = You swear you saw a blue police box flashing away on a retrograde orbit.
                KerbinInSpace = It's very... round. 
                KerbinInSpace = The planet appears to be round! It’s not flat like we thought!
                KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in, from space!”
                KerbinInSpace = This is why we need fancy suits, huh?
                KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. We’ll get back to you… about to eat lunch.”
                KerbinInSpace = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there’s nothing to walk on.
                KerbinInSpace = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
                KerbinInSpace = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!

                KerbinInSpace = Everything looks so small from up here.
                 KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here.”
                KerbinInSpace = This is Major Kerman to ground control, I’m feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
                KerbinInSpace = It’s time to leave the capsule... right?
                KerbinInSpace = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out -- maybe ankle-deep -- and the water seems inviting.
                Mun = You see a great sphere of mouldy cheese... Oh, no wait, its just the Mün.
                Mun = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.
                MunInSpace = Your ships suffers a minor depressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
                MunInSpace = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
                MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
                MunInSpace = You look back at Kerbin. I looks rather small.
                MunInSpace = “Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it’s much bigger than we thought it was.”
                MunInSpace = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
                MunInSpace = Wasn’t there an opera written about this once?
                MunInSpace = You don’t know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be… interesting.
                MunInSpace = It seems that the Mun is one big giant rock with no atmosphere.
                MunInSpace = Those craters… what could they be caused by?
                MunInSpace = Looking down at the Mun’s surface, you suddenly feel tempted to eat cheese.
                MunInSpace = “Here I am floating in a tin can, far above the Mun.”
                MunInSpaceHigh = You are very proud of yourself for reaching this far!
                MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
                MunInSpaceHigh = Hey, that looks sort of like the arch from McKerbal’s.
                Minmus = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...
                MinmusInSpace = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
                MinmusInSpace = You wonder if it’s possible to EVA to the surface and back.
                MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
                MinmusInSpace = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
                MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface…
                MinmusInSpace = Well, it’s certainly much smaller in person.
                MinmusInSpace = Jetpacking down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
                MinmusInSpace = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.
                MinmusInSpace = Kerbin looks small. The Mun looks small. Even the Sun looks small. You turn the binoculars the right way round.
            MinmusInSpace = Please let it be a sea of lime sherbert.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if Minmus tastes of mint, and if you could make a fortune selling tiny edible planets.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = You watch Minmus' surface shimmer beneath and wonder if your tongue would stick to the ground upon a thorough licking.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = Here we are. The giant mint in space.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = You look out of the window and suddenly feel homesick.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = Let’s go back, I saw a cool rock down there.
                MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.
                GillyInSpace = Yup. It's tiny.
                GillyInSpace = A rock so little must have very little gravity. Next time, you'll bring a golf club.
                GillyInSpace = How cute! Despite its potato-like appearance, Gilly is an adorable little asteroid.
                GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. You bet you could jetpack down there.
                GillyInSpace = “I didn’t know they made them this small.”
                GillyInSpace = You wonder if anything would have a TWR of less than one here.
                GillyInSpace = What is this, a moon for ants?
                GillyInSpace = This place looks a bit boring. You start calculating what it would take to deorbit it into Eve, until your calculator gives you a NaN error. Flight Control refuses to do calculations for you.
                GillyInSpace = In retrospect, you imagined it to be bigger.
                GillyInSpace = It looks small and not very tasty.
                GillyInSpace = It looks like a potato. You are starting to feel very hungry.
                GillyInSpaceLow = You look down to the surface. It's so close! Of course you don't want to end up lithobraking on those hills by accident, but at this speed it probably wouldn't be that bad.
                GillyInSpaceLow = You think you can stick your arm out and touch the surface.
                GillySrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but you are afraid that your first step will launch you right off the surface.


                GillySrfLanded = You contemplate running around the circular walls of the crew capsule like a caffeinated hamster, to see if it would generate enough force to tip over the lander.
                GillySrfLanded = You feel no change in gravity.
                GillySrfLanded = You feel a surge in gravity. Mentioning nothing to KSC, you put on your brown pants.
                Moho = Brownish red or reddish brown? It's good to think about the big questions.
                MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
                MohoInSpace = You ponder the mystery of where Moho’s atmosphere went. You’re glad it doesn’t have one anymore, because that would make coming back really hard.
                MohoInSpace = You watch the fuel gauge anxiously.
                MohoSrfLanded = It appears the heat shielding is melting. The Kerbals are sweating and hot.
                MohoSrfLanded = The crew considers which snacks would taste best if cooked.
                MohoSrfLanded = You haven't been this hot since that day in training when your suit caught fire. You worry about it happening again.
                MohoSrfLanded = Sure is hot in here.
               MohoSrfLanded = Jeb wants to know if a rover would powerslide here. Badly.
               Eve = What smells like purple?
                Eve = That is definitely a deep commitment to purple.
                EveInSpace = Eve's sky glows a beautiful green on the terminator, between day and night.
                EveInSpace = Eve looks beautiful from up here. You suspect this to be a ruse to lull you into a false sense of security.
                EveInSpace = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The oceans are mesmerizing.
                EveInSpace = Well, it’s good purple is your favorite color. Maybe there are purple flowers you can take home?
                EveInSpace = Those oceans look flammable. You’d like to see the explosion if you dropped a match in.
                EveInSpace = The world looks incredibly toxic and inhospitable.
                EveInSpace = The atmosphere shimmers like rocket fuel.
                EveSrfLanded = Maybe smuggling some snacks into the command module wasn't a bad idea, after all.
                EveSrfLanded = You still cherish the hope that you packed enough fuel.
                EveSrfLanded = The crew wonder if there are enough snacks.

                EveSrfLanded = We have successfully landed on Eve! However, the crew is expressing doubts about the lander's ability to leave.
                EveSrfLanded = You have a feeling that landing here may have been a bad idea.
                EveSrfLanded = The equipment is strained to the limits. We should be fine, as long as we don't make any sudden movements.
                EveSrfLanded = The gravity is getting to us.
                EveSrfSplashed = Even though your suit should be airtight, you swear that the capsule reeks faintly of nail polish remover.
                EveSrfSplashed = As you look out at the sea, it's purple color reminds you of your favorite soft drink.
                EveSrfSplashed = You see the purple liquid that is Eve´s ocean leak into the capsule. You get the suspicion that you may be in big trouble.
                EveSrfSplashed = Vile lakes shimmer beneath the crushing atmosphere.
                EveSrfSplashed = This reminds you of a time you saw a man get trapped in a vat of grape soda. Unfortunately, you can't drink your way out of this one.
                EveSrfSplashed = After looking through the window, you inform mission control you figured out where all the grape soda from the break room fridge keeps going.
                EveSrfSplashed = A couple mission controllers assure you that's grape juice outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins peeling the paint off the ship.
                EveSrfSplashed = You're pretty sure this *isn't* grape juice.
                EveSrfSplashed = We’re bouncing a bit too much here.
                EveSrfSplashed = The ocean is feeling a bit too cold…
                EveSrfSplashed = Short circuit in Wire Five!
                DunaInSpace = The planet looks very orange, which reminds you of the orange chicken you left in the astronaut complex fridge. You dearly hope it will still be there when you come back, because you ARE coming back. Right, Mission Control?
                DunaInSpace = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
                DunaInSpace = As you orbit the planet, you pick up what appears to be a TV signal from Kerbin. It's so badly distorted that you can't make neither head nor tail of it.
                DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.
                DunaInSpace = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light…
                DunaInSpace = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light… No, no... that’s a face.
                DunaInSpace = You gaze at the planet, and realize you'll have no problems keeping your night vision.
                DunaInSpace = You really like Duna. It reminds you of chocolate pancakes.
                DunaInSpace = Can it be kerbiformed?
                Ike = You ask Mission Control if they, too, like Ike.
                IkeInSpace = You can't help but like Ike.
                IkeInSpace = There appears to be some steep rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.
                IkeInSpace = You’ve changed your mind about Ike.
                IkeInSpace = You see a green blur, and hope it isn’t the kraken.

                IkeSrfLanded = Every moon has two sides, and you feel like you landed on the right one.
                IkeSrfLanded = Every moon has two sides, and you feel like you landed on the wrong one.
                DresInSpace = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
                DresInSpace = Looking down you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep. Too bad there’s no atmosphere, because you’d like to parachute down there.
                DresInSpace = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you miss home.
                DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown, with a few craters.
                DresInSpaceLow = It's very grey and icy down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better grey-resistant landing legs.
                DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
                DresSrfLanded = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mün. Wait.
                DresSrfLanded = It is exactly as grey and icy as expected. Not a bit of grey less, not a bit of ice more.
                DresSrfLanded = You were right… it does, in fact, seem to be a giant potato.
                Jool = We're very far from home.
                JoolInSpace = Captain's log: we are out of snacks.
                JoolInSpace = As you look down upon the great green planet, you think you can see a stirring of the clouds far, far below.
                JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below. They seem to go on forever, endlessly swirling into each other.
                JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color. More planets should be this color.
                JoolInSpace = You wonder if orange juice here is green.
                JoolInSpace = You see three big moons and two little ones. You want to land on them all.
                JoolInSpaceLow = The green colour of the atmosphere reminds you of the soft grass of Kerbin. Sort of.
                JoolInSpaceLow = You note just how big Jool is, and try not to think about how small it makes you feel. 
                JoolInSpaceLow = The massive size of the Van Allen radiation belts is ripping electrons from the ship's hull.  You carefully avoid the walls, lest you be zapped with the mother of all static discharges.
                JoolInSpaceLow = Maybe you'd be able to get a sample of metallic hydrogen before the inevitable crunch?
                JoolInSpaceLow = The green orb is looking very big now. 
                JoolFlyingHigh = While observing from the window you get startled as the Jool seems to look back at you! After a moment of confusion you find out that it was your face reflecting from the window and comment on the screams to have been "only radio chatter."
                JoolFlyingHigh = As the craft flies through the dense green clouds, it slows down dramatically.  Just don't get stuck.
                JoolFlyingHigh = It's more than disconcerting to see clouds in all directions.
                JoolFlyingHigh = You see a massive lightning bolt in the far off clouds. You nervously ask Mission Control if the ship is rated for that kind of discharge.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The planet before you resembles nothing so much as a giant tennis ball.  Perhaps it has fuzz that can be harvested to build a space elevator?
                JoolFlyingHigh = You look out the window and are amazed by the view.
                JoolFlyingHigh = You wonder if you will live to see the next hour.
                JoolFlyingHigh = You hope the aerobrake won’t be an aero landing.

                LaytheInSpace = You started daydreaming about being the captain of the Space Battleship 'Spirit of Kerbin', until being woken up by a beeping sound.
                LaytheInSpace = As the crew look down upon Laythe, they are reminded of home and the huge distance they have traveled.
                LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin. You wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
                LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You note the landmasses in your report.
                LaytheSrfLanded = After hearing the air is breathable, you open your space helmet, only to find that breathable does not mean odorless or pleasant.
                LaytheSrfLanded = One day we will have a permanent base here. One day.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The crew deliberates heavily on the correct way to pronounce 'Laythe'.
                LaytheSrfLanded = It appears that we are very much on the ground right now.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You miss your family. You begin to write a postcard.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The ocean looks inviting. You realize that you forgot your swimsuit. Oh well, KSC would never have approved.

                VallInSpace = The moon is a beautiful mosaic of blue and white.
                VallInSpace = As you stare, something stirs inside you. You make a note to cook your food more carefully next time.
                VallInSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You don't think you should try and land on them.
                VallInSpace  The moon is mostly white with lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
                VallInSpace = You wonder why this moon’s inclination is exactly the same as Laythe’s.
                TyloInSpace = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
                TyloInSpace = It's like Kerbin, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or tectonic plates. Okay, so it's not like Kerbin at all.
                TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered than the other.
                TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there...

                TyloSrfLanded = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.
                TyloSrfLanded = You feel surprisingly light.
                BopInSpace = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?

                BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
                BopInSpace = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because you’ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
                BopInSpace = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can’t help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
                BopInSpace = Stuck in an eccentric, inclined orbit, this rock offers nothing to look at. A complete waste of time.
                BopInSpace = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
                BopInSpace = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it’s hiding some dark secret...

                BopSrfLanded = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.
                BopSrfLanded = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.
                BopSrfLanded = You smell squid. The pilot must be eating sushi. What else could it be?
                BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.
                PolInSpace = Turns out Pol is real, and not just a speck of pollen on the lens of Galileo Kerman's telescope. Who knew?
                PolInSpace = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. “Pol,” you write.
                PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.

                Eeloo = As you stare down at the splintered, lifeless surface, a question forms in your mind: "Was this really worth it?"
                EelooInSpace = The crew look out towards the frozen ice ball Eeloo, and are momentarily lost for words. Few of Kerbalkind have made it this far from home, and the courage, determination, and drive their species has to put them here dawns on everyone. Their thoughts are profound and humble, that so few are supported by so many.
                EelooInSpace = It reminds you of a snowball. Is it winter already?
                EelooInSpace =  Now this is an icy planet. You start imagining epic snowball fights in microgravity.
                EelooInSpace = You note that the capsule is not equipped with central heating, and Mission Control informs you this is because you were meant to go to Moho. This does not instill you with confidence.
                EelooInSpace = It looks like a great big spherical ice cube!
                EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
                EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other planets nearby. You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe you should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
                EelooInSpace = For a moment, you can't quite remember which star is your sun.
                EelooInSpace = I feel like we could go anywhere. Let’s go. Like, now. Really, anywhere.
                EelooSrfLanded = You look out of the capsule and can't find Kerbin. What has mission control gotten you into this time?
                EelooSrfLanded = From this far away, the radio seems to be a bit patchy.  You can hear static blocking out your next instructions.  Oh well, it probably wasn't important anyway.
                EelooSrfLanded = You take notes on how barren and lonely Eeloo is. You then try to calculate how long it will take for the signal to get to and from Kerbin. 
                EelooSrfLanded = It seems you have eaten all of your snacks. You start weeping quietly in the corner.
                EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what's beneath the ice...
                EelooSrfLanded = You look out the windows and see ice. Lots and lots of ice. And some rocks here and there. Icy rocks.
                EelooSrfLanded = You wonder about the ship that got you here. Are you really sure you can get back?
                     EelooSrfLanded = As you trip and fall on a very small rock, you begin to lose feeling in your arms. Terrified of the sub zero temperatures, you look down and realize you’ve been laying on them.
                EelooSrfLanded = You feel cold.
                EelooSrfLanded = You feel very cold.
                EelooSrfLanded = You feel very hot. The physician diagnoses you with extreme hypothermia. Then you realize you hallucinated the physician.
                JoolSrfLanded = You realize that scientists may have lied to you about the feasibility of this mission.
                EveFlyingLow = If purple is the color of royalty, Eve is certainly regal!
                EveFlyingLow = They said that the crew would be getting a raise when they returned, but you've never heard of anyone getting a raise. Ever.

                MunSrfLanded = You begin to indicate concerns regarding whether or not the landing was simply an elaborate hoax, but the communications are interrupted by a strange voice telling you to keep quiet.
                MunSrfLanded = Boy, the lighting up here sure looks weird. Almost as if you were on a sound stage or something

                VallSrfLanded = You can't wait to go outside. It looks so beautiful!

                VallSrfLanded = Quakes rattle tools and loose gear every few minutes.
                JoolFlyingLow = You can feel the green all around you now. This is awesome.
                JoolFlyingLow = This seems like a situation Jebediah would like to be in, just with more SRBs and explosions.
                JoolFlyingLow = As you look up through the stormy green clouds, it strikes you that maybe flying that low in Jool's atmosphere wasn't such a good idea.
                JoolFlyingLow = The craft is shaking and feels very unstable.
                JoolFlyingLow = You realize you are not a probe.
                JoolFlyingLow = Your aerobraking attempt has turned into an aero landing.  Was this part of the plan?
                JoolFlyingLow = Mission control asks for a report, but all you can picture is a giant valedictory explosion.
                JoolFlyingLow = You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
                JoolFlyingLow = Landing on Jool, eh? Why not?
                JoolFlyingLow = Still no sign of a surface.  Perhaps if you flew even lower?
                MunFlyingHigh = You wonder if you'll be able to order pizza from here.
                EelooInSpaceHigh = The orbit of Eeloo being so odd, you begin to ponder the existence of a planet beyond it. You think a good name for this planet would be "Planet Y".
                EelooInSpaceHigh = You look out the window and notice beige stripes and spots on the surface. You immediately wonder if it's cookie dough.
                EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo looks very white; maybe someone covered it in a giant bedsheet?
                DunaFlyingHigh = You look out, and note the massive geological features. It is possible that Duna was once very geologically active.
                DunaFlyingHigh = Very small piles of fine grain red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
                DunaFlyingHigh = There seems to be something resembling a face on the surface of a planet, but it's only a play of light and shadow.
                VallInSpaceLow = Staring out the window, you realize how blue the moon is.

                LaytheSrfSplashed = You suddenly realize that you forgot to bring your towel.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = Looking at the map of Laythe to figure out which of the islands is  the closest, you know it'll be a long swim for any chance of rescue.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = As you look out the window, you see something glowing below you. You decide it's probably best to get to shore as soon as possible.
                DunaSrfLanded = Duna's surface seems to be covered with dunes. You remark that the planet was aptly-named.
                DunaSrfLanded = "It's extremely red; over."
                DunaSrfLanded = Dark spots on the surface of Duna were once thought to be the darkness of vegetation growing near the poles as the seasons change. It is now known that the dark coloration is in fact caused by seasonal dust storms.
                DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.
                DunaInSpaceHigh = You notice you are coming in close to the red planet, and you secretly hope to find intelligent life!
                DunaInSpaceHigh = The crew is concerned that the planet is "too red". Mission control does not believe this is a good reason to go home.

                EveFlyingHigh = The wind and crew are screaming.
                MohoInSpaceHigh = You discover that it is possible to fry an egg on the console by the viewport. You note it down as a possible economic reason to go into space.
                MohoInSpaceHigh = You hear the structure of the spacecraft creaking and groaning due to thermal expansion. You hope the person who designed it knew what they were doing.
                MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho is beautiful. You take a picture, then realize you're out of batteries.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.

                LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to have blocked most of Jool's radiation at this altitude. You hope your tan doesn't suffer as a result.
                LaytheFlyingLow = Are you sure we aren't on Kerbin?
                DunaFlyingLow = You shiver in your seat. Your thoughts turn to the glowing warmth of re-entry into Kerbin's atmosphere and you start to miss your family.
                MunInSpaceLow = You glance by your window at the surfa... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
                JoolInSpaceHigh = Glancing out the viewport, you see a grey disc blitz by. You start to think you are not alone.
                JoolInSpaceHigh = As you ponder at planet's hue you are reminded that green is the color preferred most by geniuses.
                EveInSpaceHigh = You think you see Gilly, but it turns out to be a spare peanut.

                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You start to feel very nervous about all the bad things you said about the Badlands.
                LaytheInSpaceLow = Your radiation instruments are showing some strange results. Perhaps Laythe has a magnetic field that is interacting with Jool's.
                LaytheFlyingHigh = Readings for alpha and beta radiation are low here, but there are still elevated readings for X-Rays and gamma radiation.
                LaytheSrfLandedIslands = You wonder if you just could sit on the beach, relax, and have a margarita.
                EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = As you see the purple ocean surrounding you, you start to wonder how you'll ever get back home.

                Gilly = You wonder how awesome it would be to make a jump with a rover from the hills here.
                GillySrfLanded = If only the launchpad had been here instead of KSC, this whole space thing would've been so much easier. You make a note to berate the administrators back home over their poor choice.
                GillySrfLanded = "Wait... there's a planet below me? Does it even have gravity?"
                GillySrfLanded = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.
                GillySrfLanded = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
                GillySrfLanded = You balance yourself on your pinky finger and start doing pushups, only to find yourself slowly floating away.
                GillySrfLanded = Using your RCS systems for balance, you manage to walk along the surface using only two fingers.
                GillySrfLanded = We could really use some anchors here.
                GillySrfLanded = You try to walk, but instead go several meters into the air. It takes minutes before you float back down.

                GillySrfLanded = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface. 
                GillySrfLanded = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you’d brought an anchor.
                GillySrfLanded = You probably shouldn’t jump. You might not come back down.
                GillySrfLanded = One small step for Kerb, one giant leap for WHAAAAA!
                GillySrfLanded = That rock you threw is still going...

                KerbinSrfSplashed = This is not the same thing as the blue stuff above us.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = This suit was obviously not intended for scuba diving.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming in front of your helmet and you start asking yourself : What would happen if my suit wasn't waterproof?
                KerbinSrfSplashed = Another water landing. You feel fortunate that the EVA suits double as emergency flotation devices.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = You feel very floaty…
                KerbinSrfSplashed = Good thing these spacesuits act like flotation devices.
                 KerbinSrfSplashed = It’s like training in the pool.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = As the water rushes to your face, you begin to thrash and wail and gasp, and then remember your suit is airtight.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = What are those creatures circling below?
                KerbinSrfSplashed = Now I really wish I knew how to swim!
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You might be ok for a few minutes.
                KerbinInSpace = You've successfully played hide and seek with Mission Control. Crap.
                KerbinInSpace = Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! I'M IN SPACE!
                KerbinInSpace = "If you’re hearing this, it means you’re taking a long time on this spacewalk. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction."
                KerbinInSpace = The lone kerbal loves it out here.
                KerbinInSpace = "Why isn't there any noise? Is something wrong with my space suit?"
                KerbinInSpace = WHEEEEEEE!

                KerbinInSpaceHigh = Staring down at tiny Kerbin, it strikes you as a planet that looks mostly harmless.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see my house from here!
                SunSrfLanded = Who are you? Scott Manley?
                SunInSpaceHigh = All you can remember while glaring at the empty void is the tale of the Space Kraken. You really want to return to the ship.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You gaze down at the majestic fireball that is Kerbol, only to realise that you have temporarily blinded yourself. 
                SunInSpaceHigh = You're suddenly alarmed at how empty space is. Just you, the sun, and... your ship. Mission Control questions why your heartbeat just spiked.
                SunInSpaceHigh = As you look toward Kerbol, you realize you forgot your sunglasses and Jeb has the only pair anyways.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You wonder if that burning smell is real or just your imagination.
                SunInSpaceHigh = Finally some peace and quiet!
                SunInSpaceHigh = You attempt to become the first Kerbal to finish a crossword puzzle in space, but alas your pencil floats away before you can even start.
                SunInSpaceHigh = "Am I stupid or just upside-down?"
                SunInSpaceHigh = It's empty.  It goes on forever, and... Oh my gosh, it's full of stars!
                SunInSpaceHigh = You decide to have a staring contest with Kerbol. You lose.
                SunInSpaceHigh = The sun appears... yellow?
                SunInSpaceHigh = Having spent time in stellar orbit, you request that you be declared a new planet. Mission Control promises to think about it.
                SunInSpaceHigh = Looking around, you notice lots of sparkly things. One of them is REALLY sparkly.
                SunInSpaceHigh = They should have sent a poet.  It's so beautiful.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You look out into the universe and wonder if you're alone, if Kerbin is a cradle of life in an otherwise sterile universe. Mission Control tells you to stop thinking so much.
                SunInSpaceHigh = It would have been better if it was green.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You feel kind of small right now... you hope you know where you're going.
                SunInSpaceHigh = You search in every direction, but there is no kraken to be seen.
                SunInSpaceHigh = Suddenly you hear a deep growling. Is that the space kraken?

                SunInSpaceLow = As you stare at Kerbol, you manage to resist the urge to take off your helmet to have some toasted Marshmallows.
                SunInSpaceLow = Your thermometer blew up inside the cabin. That can't be a good sign.
                SunInSpaceLow = It's a dry heat.
                SunInSpaceLow = You really wish you'd brought marshmallows. You bet you could make a mean s'more from here.
                SunInSpaceLow = You can't wait to tell your friends about flying near the Sun with nothing but your spacesuit on.
                SunInSpaceLow = Good thing you brought your 4000+ sunscreen
                SunInSpaceLow = The suit feels a bit warm.
                SunInSpaceLow = Outside the ship, you can really see the power of the sun. As you watch, you see a flash on the surface and a tongue of plasma shoots off.
                SunInSpaceLow = You wonder if the radiation from Kerbol is harming you in any way.
                SunInSpaceLow = Your spacesuit is starting to heat up now. Maybe it's a good idea to get back to your spacecraft.
                SunInSpaceLow = Is it just me, or is it hot in here? 
                SunInSpaceLow = You are starting to sweat profusely and wonder why you had left the capsule in the first place.
                SunInSpaceLow = You feel as if you should have brought a stronger sunscreen.
                SunInSpaceLow = It feels a bit warm.
                SunInSpaceLow = A massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity! This one appears to be undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core.
                SunInSpaceLow = Kerbol is bigger then you have ever could have seen it on Kerbin. You wish you'd brought your Sunglasses.
                SunInSpaceLow = You’re feeling really hot and can’t stand the unbearable heat.
                SunInSpaceLow = You think coming this close to the sun was REALLY a bad idea. Can we leave now?
                SunInSpaceLow = “Ohhh, the Sun! I'm gonna meet the Sun. Oh no! What'll I say? 'Hi! Hi, Sun!' Oh, boy!”
                SunInSpaceLow = You crack a bad joke about landing on the sun at night to mission control.
                SunInSpaceLow = Since the solar panels produce more energy, you crank up the air conditioner.
                SunInSpaceLow = You realise that this is not where you want to be right now.
                KerbinFlyingLow = I'm free! Freefalling.
                KerbinFlyingLow = This is a most precarious situation.
                KerbinFlyingLow = Flying this close to the ground is definitely not over-rated!
                KerbinFlyingLow = Get back in! Quick!
                KerbinFlyingLow = The ground is looking awful close. Did you pack a parachute?
                KerbinFlyingLow = This isn’t that high up after all…
                KerbinFlyingLow = I wonder if I can buzz the tower while hanging off the side of the cockpit...
                KerbinFlyingHigh = The clouds look so pretty from up here.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = You're starting to feel you should really get back into the ship.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Did you remember to pack a parachute?
                KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue, and there’s nothing you can do.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = It’s so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.
                Mun = It looks like a really big rock.
                MunSrfLanded = You feel a peculiar quake. When you look behind you, there is a fresh meteor impacted where you were just walking.
                MunSrfLanded = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.
                MunSrfLanded = You wonder how that rock got into your spacesuit.
                MunSrfLanded = It doesn't -taste- like it's made of dairy...
                MunSrfLanded = "Did I leave the keys in the ignition?"
                MunSrfLanded = You should have brought your golf club.
                MunSrfLanded = The dust is getting everywhere!
                MunSrfLanded = You confirm that the Mun is not made out of cheese. Mission Control is very sad.
                MunSrfLanded = That dust is getting into everything… Now stop staring and help me clean my visor!
                MunSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Suddenly, you feel very small.
                MunSrfLanded = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
                MunSrfLanded = You really want to jump again, but last time Mission Control yelled at you.
                MunSrfLanded = That’s one small step fo--the situation is nominal.
                MunSrfLanded = That’s one small step for a Kerbal, and one big cupboard of snacks for said Kerbal.

                MunSrfLanded = You’re in a most peculiar way, and the stars look very different today.
                MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!

                MunFlyingLow = You're having a bit too much fun with the low gravity.
                MunFlyingLow = You try flapping your arms to go higher. After doing this, you try to perform a facepalm, but only manage a visor palm.
                MunFlyingHigh = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
                MinmusSrfLanded = As you exit your craft, you utter the words; "It's one small step for kerbals, one giant leap for kerbal kind."
                MinmusSrfLanded = Engine's exhaust seems to have melted the ice underneath.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You spend several minutes contemplating how to taste the ground without removing your space suit's helmet before giving up.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You have confirmed that the surface does not taste like mint ice cream.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You need to do something about the lack of snacks here.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You feel a bit like a superhero when you jump in the low gravity.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You are craving mint ice cream right about now.
                MinmusSrfLanded = The low gravity would make driving around difficult.
                MinmusSrfLanded = If the spaceship fails, you could probably use the jetpack to get back into orbit.
                MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to be a mixture of rock and ice… you wonder if it could be mined for fuel.
                MinmusSrfLanded = These ice lakes are so flat and smooth, you suspect they would make an excellent drag strip.
                DunaSrfLanded = You've proven the alien conspiracy theorists wrong. There are no tall, pink men anywhere to be seen.
                DunaSrfLanded = Would this be a good place to have giant sandworms for pets?
                DunaSrfLanded = You feel like a true hero as you march across the red planet, until you realize you're a long, long way from home.
                DunaSrfLanded = I'm hungry. Where is my pizza? 
                DunaSrfLanded = Duna's low gravity would lend itself well to an exciting game of baskerbal! You consider adding a hoop to your next lander design.
                DunaSrfLanded = You see red. A LOT of red.
                DunaSrfLanded = After much testing, you determine that red sand castles are plausible.
                DunaSrfLanded = The air is a little thin up here. Down here?
                DunaSrfLanded = A gust of wind creates a small red dust storm, it’s hard to see. 
                Ike = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life coul- "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
                IkeSrfLanded = It seems like a hike would be nice.  What might you see from the other side of this moon?  Pack plenty of air!
                IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
                IkeSrfLanded = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Duna is not moving or rotating. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.
                IkeSrfLanded = You look up at the sky and see something zip past...
                IkeSrfLanded = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface. The surface appears to react oddly to light.
                IkeSrfLanded = You get a strange sense of deja-vu.
                DresFlyingHigh = It’s an airless rock floating through space, all alone and lonely. Sniff.
                DresSrfLanded = For a planet of this size and gravity, there are an awful lot of craters.
                DresSrfLanded = When you look closely at the ground, you can see many different types of deposits mixed together.
                DresSrfLanded = You feel like a few smaller rocks should be visible in the distance. However, when you look up, you spot nothing of the sort.
                JoolFlyingHigh = You feel your skin burn as you leave the vessel. It would be a good idea to get back on board!
                JoolFlyingHigh = You find that the outside pressures are equal with your suit's interior pressure. Removing your helmet would still be a rather poor idea.
                JoolFlyingHigh = Feeling insignificant near the towering mass of the gas giant, you are inclined to think that size matters after all.
                JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You feel drunk because of the thin air. Mission Control asks you to put your helmet back on.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You wonder if you could swim to the next island from here.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You are glad to see the solid ground, but it seems that after such a long journey you almost forgot how to walk.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You are sorely tempted to remove your helmet.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Can I take off my space suit?
                LaytheSrfLanded = You realize that you forgot to bring sunscreen.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You feel comfortable, back at Kerbin after such a long sleep. Wait a minute...
                LaytheSrfLanded = You search the sky, hoping to see Jool.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Gazing around the landscape, you feel very homesick.
                LaytheSrfLanded = There might be good diving on this planet. Unfortunately, mission control did not pack any flippers.
                LaytheSrfLanded = It is much colder here than the scan from orbit suggested.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You feel a slight tremor. Perhaps you should have landed on that OTHER island.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Comfortable enough to take your helmet off, you check the box for “Looks breathable.”
                LaytheSrfLanded = You take your helmet off, and after a few very long seconds of gasping and haphazard flailing you manage to secure your helmet again. You erase the checkbox for “breathable atmosphere.”
                LaytheSrfLanded = You try to open your helmet’s protective glass ever so slightly. The air is rough, humid and thin. You gasp for oxygen but there is not much to be found. Maybe kerbals with more high-altitude experience would do just fine.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You do a series of breathing exercises and open your helmet to try Laythian air. It feels fine but gives you a strong sense of intoxication. You decide it’s because of lower oxygen content.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The air looks tolerable and the water looks very inviting. A beautiful place to be!
                LaytheSrfLanded = After determining that the air is, if only just, breathable, you ponder whether turbojet engines would be able to run here.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = The low land to water ratio and sedate water cycle of Laythe combine to give its oceans low salinity. You're forced to constantly swim to keep afloat.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you could swim to the nearest island.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You realise that this is the first bath you have had since leaving Kerbin. 
                LaytheSrfSplashed = As much as you'd like to find life, the only green wiggling creature here is in a spacesuit.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You start thinking of how cool it would be to have motorboats here. You then proceed to make motorboat sounds.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You attempt to drink some water. Then you remember the co-worker who died after ordering some "H2O too".
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You tread water. Perhaps you should have chosen a drier landing spot.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = Swimming is really hard in these suits you know.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = Your Geiger Counter is emitting a continuous hum. Time to flee.
                Vall = You see a sparkling stream of crystals blast into the sky in the distance.

                TyloSrfLanded = You look around, trying to decide if the nerve-wracking descent was worth it. How are you going to get back?
                TyloSrfLanded = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.

                BopSrfLanded = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it’s probably just your suit being out of order.

                BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there’s something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.

                EelooSrfLanded = You lay down and give the planet a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.
                EelooSrfLanded = You want to build a snow-kerbal. Sadly, Eeloo is made of ice, not snow.

                EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what would come of an ice-carving competition held here.
                EelooSrfLanded = You suddenly realize that there’s no way you’ll be able to walk home from here.

                EveFlyingLow = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.

                MunSrfLandedCanyons = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there. 
                KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You look at the inviting waves and realize that you forgot your swimsuit!
                KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Ew! Something just touched your foot. Oh wait, it's just seaweed.

                default = You break off a piece of the ground. It tastes like dirt!
                default = After kicking the ground several times, you are convinced it is solid and should be taken home to investigate.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You wonder why you put on a two-million-dollar space suit and got into  a multi-billion dollar rocket just to pick up some dirt.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Looks like dirt.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Beautiful green grass.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Still dirt.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = This is some quality grass.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I didn’t sign up for this.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = An incredibly long, furry, purple creature slithers bizarrely out of the grass. You rub your eyes and when you look again there is nothing in sight.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I got a jar o’ dirt! I got a jar o’ dirt!
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You pick at the dirt and discover a worm under the grass. You promptly name him Kelbin and attempt to hug him but end up squishing him in your arms. You feel bad so you open up a container and gently place him inside.
                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Dirt, grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a groundbreaking discovery.

                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You find a tiny fleck of a shiny yellow material among the rocks. It seems that there is gold in these hills.
                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The air is thin, the climate is frigid, and the ground is impenetrable.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you're in a climate-controlled suit, because it sure looks hot out there. 
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Sand, sand, and more sand.  A rock adds some badly needed variety to the landscape.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You saw a blue box on the horizon, but it was just an illusion. Also, you picked up a stone.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You remember your wilderness survival training… wait, do you need that training in space? What are you doing here in the desert? Someone is going to answer for this.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here is partially frozen and tufts of moose hair cover the matted grass.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the cracking sounds. You try to not think back on how you landed there.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You take a sample of the “ice.” Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = You pick up a small creature with far too many legs. Mission control denies your request to keep it as a pet.
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = You scoop up some watery sand and decide the best use for it is to build a sand castle.
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = Hey look, a wristwatch! Finders, keepers!
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = You build a sand castle, then take a sample of it. It’s sand.
                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The grass here is definitely not as green as it is in other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called “the Badlands” makes you feel cool.
                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Rock, coal, and dead plant matter make up the sample.
                KerbinSrfLandedWater = You scoop up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample, you hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
                KerbinSrfSplashed = "Dihydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = There seems to be a lot of a liquid substance.  Surely this will be a huge advancement in science as we know it.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = This material seems to take on the shape of whatever container it is placed in. More study is needed.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You seem to have captured a small crustacean. Mission Control is less than impressed.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Curious - something essential to life that isn't green, isn't explosive, and doesn't start with "K."
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
                KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Is that an engine bell?
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You attempt to pry off a sample, but Mission Control yells at you.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Don’t we already know what this is made out of?
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You bend down to "gather samples," but decide to make some chalk drawings instead. 
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Getting a sample here will be tricky. Hey look, a penny!
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The sample is composed of some sort of grey rock, with one half of it nearly perfectly smooth.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Mission Control would like to remind you that, while we appreciate your efforts towards research, we already have a good understanding of the makeup of our runway.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land on.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = After examining the asphalt, you conclude that it would be a great place to cook an egg.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You're sure this area is pretty well studied, but you did find a nickle.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Dirt, dust, and burnt flecks of steel make up the sample.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Looks like… dirt. And rocks. And more dirt. Why are you out here again?
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your metal detector beeps and whizzes a bit. After careful digging, you find part of the engine from Jeb’s pickup truck. How it got there you don’t know, but you do know why Jeb’s truck isn’t in the parking lot today.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You see small metal scraps from the latest rocket explosion scattered around the ground.
                Mun = Done and dusted.
                MunSrfLanded = You take a sample and confirm that the Mun is not made of cheese.
                MunSrfLanded = Wensleydale? Stilton? It isn't like any cheese you've tasted. You wonder if its actually cheese at all. 
                MunSrfLanded = You suddenly realize why the physical examination screened for breathing problems.
                MunSrfLanded = Oddly enough, the sample smells similar to swiss cheese. One wonders if it's edible.
                MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.
                MunSrfLanded = Unfortunately, it's not cheese. You double-check it, but it still isn't.
                MunSrfLanded = You note the sample's lack of cheese.
                MunSrfLanded = The surface appears to be a fine dust with a greyish tone. Seems too flaky to make snowballs with.
                MunSrfLanded = Finally, something that isn’t dirt: a rock!
                MunSrfLanded = So, breccias are actually kind of boring.
                MunSrfLanded = Through extensive and professional testing, you find out that, contrary to popular belief, the Mun is not made of cheese. Also, you immediately regret your testing.
                MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = The ground appears to be made of very small, sharp, abrasive pieces of grey rock. It would probably be best if you didn't rub your space suit against the stuff. 
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = Very... rocky.
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = The darker midlands surface appears to be made up of basaltic rocks.
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = The sample contains odd glass spherules of various colors. They're quite pretty!
                MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The sample contains evidence of a weak, localized magnetic field.
                MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The surface here consists of multiple types of rock. Some appear almost crystalline.

                MunSrfLandedNorthWestCrater = Deeper samples seems to contain more fragmented and shattered formations of rock.
                MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The sample appears to be radioactive.
                MunSrfLandedSouthWestCrater = There appears to be layers of completely different materials here.  It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.
                MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Tiny flecks of purple flesh dot the mineral deposits here. The texture of the crater looks quite puckered. Is this evidence that this was once the home of the legendary Kraken?
                MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.
                MunSrfLandedCanyons = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured here.
                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = To your surprise, you find a large lump of ice lodged in the center of the crater. Upon further analysis you find that it doesn't taste particularly well, and is too chunky for the snow-cone machine.
                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = You examine the sample you’ve collected, and throw it into the container for further testing.
                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder if this would make a nice snack.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realise that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you’ve collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.
                MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The sample seems to contain frozen liquids... we should send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.
                MunSrfLandedHighlands = You take a small rock and your nine iron, place the rock on a T, and knock it into low orbit. 
                MunSrfLandedHighlands = The Mun dust here is light and thin... It's very poor sandcastle-building material. That doesn't stop you from making one. 
                MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
                MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = Seems muddy, in a waterless kind of way.  You find it appropriate to remove your shoes before boarding the ship again, no thought given to the problems of removing space attire while still outside.
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = This crater seems to filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
                MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
                MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
                MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for something neat.
                MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Then, you throw a less cool looking rock into the sample container.
                MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = This crater must have had a really nasty impact, the samples are heavier than normal.
                MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = You're glad that the Mun's gravity is so low. Digging is backbreaking work!
                MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Definitely not Cheddar. Winchester? No. Dorset Blue Vinney? Nah.
                MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = This area has a particularly high concentration of rare elements. Nice! 
                MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Continual samples of this area confirm it is rich in useful materials.
                MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = You dig around for a nice sample of the crater, carefully selecting some of everything.
                Minmus = As you gather up some Minmus material, you label it as "Definitely not ice".
                MinmusSrfLanded = You scoop a sample up to be analysed back home, then smear some over your gloves to sniff when you get back in the capsule. You bet it'll smell minty and delicious.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You taste the sample, and find that it does not taste like mint at all. You wonder where the medicine cabinet went.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You are disappointed to discover that the sample does not taste like ice cream, but instead tastes more like frozen yogurt.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control tentatively asks you how it tastes.
                MinmusSrfLanded = After excavating the surface, you find a hidden ice layer. The ice appears to have a slightly greenish tinge to it. Upon further examination, you find it to have the perfect consistency for snow-cones, yet the taste leaves much to be desired.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You try to taste the sample but your helmet gets in the way.
                MinmusSrfLanded = The white mountains have a snow-like surface. The frozen lakes seem to be made of the same substance, but much smoother.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Must... not... taste... 
                MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains. They are very pretty, but probably not edible. Probably.
                MinmusSrfLanded = You sneak a taste of the surface sample... nope, it definitely is not made of delicious dessert products.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Surface samples confirm that it is not made out of mint, even though it looks and tastes like it.
                Eve = Oooooo. Purple!
                EveSrfLanded = It appears that the upper layers of the surface are by far the most purple. Perhaps whatever causes this colour falls as precipitation.
                EveSrfLanded = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel.  Is it worth it?  Sure!  It's purple!
                EveSrfLanded = You try to analyze the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.
                EveSrfLanded = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
                EveSrfLanded = What could have possibly turned this soil purple?
                EveSrfLanded = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.
                EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
                EveSrfLanded = The surface appears to have a very strong purple tint to it... or is it just reflecting that color from its surroundings? You start to wonder if you're not taking on a purple tint yourself.
                EveSrfLanded = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
                EveSrfLanded = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.
                EveSrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.
                EveSrfLanded = I’ve come all this way for THIS?
                EveSrfLanded = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 kerbals.
                EveSrfSplashed = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
                EveSrfSplashed = The purple water dyes the suit pink.
                EveSrfSplashed = Further analysis will determine if this liquid is indeed grape-flavoured, as you hope it is.
                EveSrfSplashed = Johnny was a chemist's son, / But Johnny is no more; / What Johnny thought was H2O / was H2SO4.
                EveSrfSplashed = You try tasting your sample, and find that it is indeed not grape soda.
                EveSrfSplashed = This purplish liquid sample looks like your favourite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.
                EveSrfSplashed = You find traces of liquid Blutonium. 
                EveSrfSplashed = This liquid looks an awful lot like mercury now that you've collected it in a bottle. You hope your suit is as waterproof as the manual promised.
                EveSrfSplashed = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin’s core.
                Duna = The exact chemical composition of the surface will no doubt be of interest to the scientists back home.
                Duna = Different colored rocks are probably made of different stuff. You should grab as many as you can. 
                DunaSrfLanded = It appears this soil could be used for snack production, possibly after several centuries of kerbal-forming.
                DunaSrfLanded = This red dust could be iron oxide, or possibly paprika.
                DunaSrfLanded = You wonder if you need to take a sample considering there is so much dust on you that you could be considered a sample on your own right.
                DunaSrfLanded = Nope. Not barbecue flavored.
                DunaSrfLanded = Yup. Dust. Are you surprised?
                DunaSrfLanded = It's very thin and fine. You imagine a rover could easily become stuck in this if it had small wheels.
                DunaSrfLanded = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine, sand-like dust. It appears to be getting everywhere.
                DunaSrfLanded = This sand works well for drawing pictures on your space suit.
                DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be traces of water in the soil!
                DunaSrfLanded = Unable to satisfy your curiosity, you attempt to drill into the rock. It would be much easier if you had a machine to help.
                DunaSrfLanded = You make a note: “Bring laser next time.”
                DunaSrfLanded = The small rock you pick up seems to be of sedimentary origin. You wonder if there was ever a lake here.
                DunaSrfLanded = You find a nice metal ruler in the sand! You’re ready to proclaim the discovery of an alien civilization, but then you find that the one in your suit is missing.
                DunaSrfLanded = The rock you’ve picked up seems to contain a lot of iron oxide III. As such, it’s not tasty, nor particularly healthy.
                DunaSrfLanded = Too bad it’s only red spice. It would have been much better to go to Eve.
                DunaSrfLanded = You pick up a soil sample. It looks a bit like limestone. You consider it important and put it into your sample container.
                DunaSrfLanded = It looks like some sort of spice.  
                MohoSrfLanded = The sample shows signs of past volcanic activity.
                MohoSrfLanded = The sample shows signs of scorch marks and intense heat, but you already knew that.
                MohoSrfLanded = The sample is very brittle and is covered with micro-cracks. It suggests that a superheated atmosphere may have once existed here.
                MohoSrfLanded = The ground is made up of old lava flows, suggesting periods of intense volcanic activity.
                MohoSrfLanded = Rocks lying around seem to be ejecta from volcanic eruptions.
                MohoSrfLanded = Rocks all look the same to you. Wishing you had taken that geology course back on Kerbin, you try to break some stones by hitting them hard against each other. They seem to be very sturdy and don’t break at all.
                MohoSrfLanded = Ahah! You spot a familiar-looking rock a couple of meters away from you. It reminds you of the snack pack you’ve just eaten.
                MohoSrfLanded = Yup, its a chunk of Moho.

                MinmusInSpace = The high radiation has caused a few of the samples to glow. It looks like it would be fun to paint the rocket with this.
                MinmusInSpace = The samples react to the lack of an atmosphere.
                EveInSpace = The materials bay, after an apparent deliberation, produces a liquid. It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.

                EveSrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
                EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if the samples have changed color, or if it's just the lighting.

                EelooSrfLanded = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.
                EelooSrfLanded = You look away, and some of the materials shape into a dog.
                EelooSrfLanded = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.

                EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.
                EelooInSpace = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.
                EelooInSpace = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.

                KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = The lunar soil has mixed with one of the materials, producing a grey paste that is getting everywhere.
                SunInSpaceHigh = The rocks show little signs of change. Some phosphorous samples glow a bright blue color, indicating the high radiation of interplanetary space.

                EveSrfLandedCraterLake = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!
                EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.
                EveSrfLandedMountains = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
                DresInSpace = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples.  Probably a micro-meteor or some swamp gas. You had nothing to do with it.
                TyloInSpaceHigh = The metal is metallic, the wood is wooden, the glass is glassy. If Tylo is going change any of this you will have to get closer.
                GillyInSpaceLow = It looks like someone's been trying to hide snacks in the Materials Lab.

                LaytheSrfSplashed = Temperatures are similar to those of Kerbin’s polar regions. The water hasn’t frozen, though, most probably due to the high salinity.
                TyloSrfLanded = It reads cold until you realize that all of the liquid in the thermometer has just pooled at the bottom.
                BopSrfLanded = The thermometer reads 66.6 degrees Celsius. That...that can't be right.
                BopSrfLanded = Bop’s temperature seems highly suspect…
                BopSrfLanded = Bop is trying to mislead your temperature readings. Or maybe it’s not Bop, but something that lives on Bop?

                EelooSrfLanded = After a long and thoughtful evaluation of the data using knowledge of thermodynamics and various fancy methods, you determine that Eeloo is, in fact, too cold to sensibly enjoy an ice cream cone on.
                EelooSrfLanded = Its a wee bit chilly.
                EelooSrfLanded = It's too cool for school.
                EelooSrfLanded = The ground temperature is higher than the surrounding space by a fraction of a degree.
                EelooSrfLanded = You watch the mercury in the thermometer break through the bottom and freeze. 
                EelooSrfLanded = The display reads "really cold." You make a note to get a less sassy thermometer. 
                EelooSrfLanded = The temperature is surprisingly hot.  Perhaps there's some volcanic activity? ...nevermind, someone put the thermometer on upside down.
                EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer reads "Way too cold." You are beginning to question the qualifications of the science department.
                EelooSrfLanded = Temperatures have dropped bEeloo zero.
                EelooSrfLanded = What’s colder than being cold? ICE COLD!
                EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer picks up trace amounts of temperature.
                EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer seems to be shivering. You give it a scarf and a mug of cocoa.
                EelooSrfLanded = The mercury seems to have retreated into the bulb at the bottom.  You peck at the bulb several times, hoping for it to reemerge.  Is it really that cold?
                KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
                LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.
                VallInSpace = It's incredibly cold, but every now and then the temperature rises. Plumes of heat must be coming off the moon below.
                VallSrfLanded = There is a section below the surface that has a surprisingly high temperature for Vall. Being Vall, of course, it's still quite cold.
                VallSrfLanded = After scraping flecks of ice off the meter, you confirm that yes, it is indeed very cold out.
                TyloInSpace = Reflected light from Tylo doesn't appear to transfer much heat to the surrounding space.
                EveSrfSplashed = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.
                EveSrfSplashed = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.


                EveSrfSplashed = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.
                DunaInSpace = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Perhaps the greenhouse effect here is rather weak.
                DunaFlyingLow = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise a kid. Matter of fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
                PolInSpaceLow = The thermometer wants to come inside because it's cold.
                PolInSpaceLow = The temperature varies as you fly over the terrain.
                MohoInSpaceLow = You guessed it would be at least a million billion degrees this close to the Sun... but it isn't.
                MohoInSpaceLow = This wasn't tested for such temperatures.
                MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN.  One of the wires must have come loose again.
                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It's pretty cold here. You'd almost think Kerbol hadn't shined here crater since it was formed!
                MunSrfLandedCanyons = The thermometer is shivering from the cold.  With the high walls blocking all the sunlight, this is not surprising.
                MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The blackened rocks absorb and radiate large quantities of the Sun's heat.  You briefly consider the idea of sunbathing, but realize you don't have a beach towel.  Oh well...
                MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The long shadows cast by the crater rims make this region colder than the surrounding highlands.
                MunSrfLandedMidlands = The surface here seems to reflect much of the Sun's heat.  As a result, it is slightly cooler here.
                MohoSrfLandedCentralCrater = The experiment is a success! The team predicted there would be numbers in the data!
                MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The temperature reading suggests that this area might be made of ice cream.  Acquiring a surface sample is highly recommended.
                MohoSrfLandedPolarCrater = The thermal gradient data forms a very pretty chart.
                EelooSrfLandedPoles = The instrumentation appears to have given up.
                EelooSrfLandedScarring = Even the more pleasant parts of this planet are inhospitable.
                EelooSrfLandedLowlands = You note the temperature and add a memo that all future manned missions should pack plenty of warm clothes.
                EelooSrfLandedLowlands = The team at KSC still doesn't know how this instrument works, but is fascinated by how low the numbers can go.
                KerbinInSpaceHigh = The temperature reading fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
                MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh." You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks. 
                JoolInSpaceHigh = The thermometer says the temperature is 7000, but refuses to say what units it is using.

	RESULTS
	{
	default = The instrument refuses to cooperate until you warn it about breaking the ideal gas laws. 
                default = You get thirsty and think about drinking from the barometer, but you can't tell if it's a water or mercury barometer and decide against it.
                default = The pressure levels appear to be negative, until you slap the computer and the values return to normal.
                default = Every time KSC asks you to transmit the readout, you feel like a TV-weathercaster.
                default = The reading says "Hurricane". Tapping on the glass doesn't help.
                default = As entertaining as it is to blow on the sensor and watch the needle move, Mission Control insists that's not what it's there for.
                default = You wonder why the screen is blank. Then you realize you forgot to turn it on.
                default = Collected and recorded atmospheric pressure data from the surroundings.
                KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a fine day today.
                KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a storm will arrive later. Version 0.25 maybe?
                KerbinFlyingLow = The pressure is lower here than it was at ground level.
                MohoFlyingLow = The barometer reading is too low to measure. This planet has no atmosphere.
                MohoSrfLanded = The barometer is still reading nothing.
                MohoSrfLanded = You could have sworn there was an atmosphere on Moho, but the barometer reads nothing.
                MohoSrfLanded = You’re pretty sure the barometer just showed an atmosphere! Oh, wait, that was just the engine exhaust.
                MohoSrfLanded = Remembering heroic science fiction stories about crews trying to survive in Moho’s extremely hot atmosphere, you just shrug with disappointment.
                EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
                EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
                EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
                EveFlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is very high even at this altitude.
                EveSrfLanded = The pressure is cursing down here!  You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.
                EveSrfLanded = Atmosphere? Yes!
                EveSrfLanded = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing."
                EveSrfLanded = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.
                EveSrfLanded = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any kerbals there.
                EveSrfLanded = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.
                EveSrfLanded = It's buried the needle!
                EveSrfLanded = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.
                EveSrfLanded = The atmosphere is very dense at the surface. It crushes down on the instrumentation.
                EveSrfLanded = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.
                EveSrfLanded = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.
                GillySrfLanded = The barometer registers something as a speck of dust lands in the sensor.
                GillySrfLanded = You think that you've got a reading for a second... nope, just a smudge on the gauge.
                GillySrfLanded = Doing pressure measurements on Gilly? Are you stupid or something?
                MunFlyingLow = Just for kicks you measure the pressure here. Yep, no atmosphere.
                MunSrfLanded = The pressure gauge is sitting there motionless. Perhaps you should tap it a few times to be sure?
                MunSrfLanded = They say insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results. You check the gauge again. Still nothing.
                MunSrfLanded = The barometer shows zero. Somehow this hurts your feelings.
                DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
                DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere is very thin here, but it is enough to register on the instrumentation.
                DunaFlyingLow = Even the barometer isn’t sure how to interpret the readings.
                DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads "Gasping for air!" You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking. 
                DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
                DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere is pretty thin even at the surface. You don't think parachutes or wings would work very well here.
                DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it’s still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
                DunaSrfLanded = There isn’t much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
                IkeFlyingLow = There appears to be no atmosphere here.
                IkeSrfLanded = Barometer is quite a fun word, way more fun than what barometer actually does. Or these readings for that matter, which are just solid, round zeroes.
                IkeSrfLanded = The gauge reads nothing, even on the surface.
                IkeSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere. But there are very few moons with atmospheres, so what did you expect?
                JoolFlyingLow = You notice the barometer has a crack in it shaped like a doughnut. There's also a reading about the pressure, but you've stopped caring. 
                JoolFlyingLow = The barometer's hand switched from "You sure we're in an atmosphere and not underwater?" to "Look, I wasn't built to record pressures in kbar". It suddenly dawns on you that you might have aerobraked a bit too deep.
                JoolFlyingLow = The sensor starts breaking under pressure.
                JoolFlyingLow = The immense pressure causes the sensor to implode.
                JoolFlyingLow = Pressure increases quite rapidly, then stabilises on "-65535". It occurs to you that barometer may be broken.
                JoolFlyingLow = The barometer reads lower than expected.  Perhaps you are in the eye of a storm?
                JoolFlyingLow = The barometer lets out some steam and fails to give a proper reading of the immensely thick atmosphere.
                JoolFlyingLow = The scanner only has time to say "I hate you" before the voice module implodes.
                JoolFlyingLow = The gas chamber just cracked. Any deeper and this whole craft might implode.
                JoolFlyingLow = The pressures here are immense. The instrument is beginning to fail.
                JoolFlyingLow = Jool seems to be under a lot of pressure right now.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The pressures start rising in comparison to the surrounding area. You take this as a good sign -- Joolian storms are nothing to sneeze at.
                JoolFlyingHigh = A massive blast of wind shakes the spacecraft. Of course, you didn't exactly need a barometer to tell you this.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is very dense. The glass components appear to be weakening. Let's blame the engineers if anything breaks!
                JoolFlyingHigh = The pressure here is very high. It seems dangerous to probe any deeper.
                Laythe = The atmosphere here is unusually dense.
                LaytheFlyingLow = The pressure seems higher over the water.
                LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
                LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
                LaytheFlyingLow = There is definitely an atmosphere. Pressures are fairly nominal.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The barometer predicts rain.
                LaytheSrfLanded = For a couple of seconds you think the device is still displaying readings taken on Kerbin.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The readings are almost the same as on a sunny beach back home. It makes you feel like going for a swim.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is a bit lower than on Kerbin. You are unsure if that makes it more fun or not.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure is lower than on Kerbin, but you don’t think seasoned mountaineers would have any trouble adapting to it.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The pressures here seem to be a bit lower than that of Kerbin. Definitely manageable, though.
                VallFlyingLow = There does not appear to be any atmosphere to sample.
                VallSrfLanded = Gases rising from the planet occasionally register slight pressures. That, or the instrument is on the fritz.
                VallSrfLanded = If there is an atmosphere, it’s way too thin to register on the barometer.
                Tylo = Searching for an atmosphere on this barren rock is rather futile.
                TyloFlyingLow = Surprisingly, you discover no traces of atmosphere.
                TyloSrfLanded = The vacuum seems a little bit thicker here.
                TyloSrfLanded = There is no detectable atmospheric pressure here. Fascinating!
                TyloSrfLanded = Why such a massive body acquired no atmosphere is a complete mystery to you.
                BopFlyingLow = It's a giant rock floating through space. What did you expect?
                BopSrfLanded = Yup. Just a rock.
                BopSrfLanded = Instruments again support the theory that asteroids are too small to have an atmosphere.
                PolFlyingLow = Nothing to report here.
                PolSrfLanded = No atmospheric pressure is detectable on Pol.
                EelooFlyingLow = The instrument doesn't register any pressure here.
                EelooSrfLanded = The air here, besides being absent, is also very lonely.
                EelooSrfLanded = Beep... beep... beep... boop. The instrument has frozen up.
                EelooSrfLanded = The indicator shifts back and forth, then finally settles on zero.
                EelooSrfLanded = No trace of an atmosphere. In this intense cold, most gases would have frozen and precipitated to the surface.
                DresSrfLanded = If there is an atmosphere, it's way too thin for the barometer to detect. Such a disappointment.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = You contemplate dunking the scanner to see if it can measure depth, but mission control says that will void the warranty.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = Atmospheric pressure at sea level is quite high, but still less than on Kerbin. Well, it's a moon, give it a break!
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storms fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight!
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer. 
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time.
                KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = It's not going to rain for a long time.
                KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
                LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarified, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.
                EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.
                MinmusSrfLanded = The barometer displays "0" in a surprisingly condescending fashion.
                EveSrfSplashed = The pressure is very high.  You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this purple sea.
                EveSrfSplashed = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer reads low pressure. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later. 
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
                DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
                DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
                DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
                DunaSrfLandedMaria = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.
                DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
                DunaSrfLandedMountains = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
                DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.
                DunaSrfLandedMidlands = There's air here, but not much of it.
                DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
                DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.

                default = You wonder if another location would give different readings.
                default = Gathered precise acceleration data while subjecting the vessel to this situation.
                default = There is no reading.
                default = You can’t help but imagine yourself sliding along the curve the data makes. Wee!
                KerbinSrfSplashed = The sensor detects an incoming tsunami.
                KerbinSrfLanded = It appears there is normal seismic activity under the layers of dirt. 
                Moho = There is a strong anomaly in the sensor that you can't determine the cause of. After much deliberation, you decide to ignore it.
                MohoSrfLanded = The meter shows the maximum amount of force needed to jiggle Jebediah's love-handles for a fortnight.
                MohoSrfLanded = This place seems much calmer than you would think. Tests indicate that there hasn't been any geologic activity in billions of years.
                MohoSrfLanded = Thermal expansion from the sun is causing geological activity.
                MohoSrfLanded = The shaking of the needle reminds you how cold the dark side of this planet gets.
                MohoSrfLanded = Despite the tremendous heat of the sun, thermal expansion isn't causing any noteworthy movement.
                MohoSrfLanded = The sensor detects vibrations deep inside the planet. It appears that the interior is very volcanically active.
                MohoSrfLanded = Odd reflections are detected in the recorded vibrations. This might tell us more about the interior structure.
                MohoSrfLanded = The sensor picks up anomalous vibrations from deep within the planet. You wonder what could be down there.
                MohoSrfLanded = A small rumble shakes the cockpit before you can access the sensor.
                EveSrfLanded = The scan yields a great deal of important information, but none of it says "purple."
                EveSrfLanded = The scan hints at Eve's crust structure.
                EveSrfLanded = The sensor has detected possible seismic activity below the surface. 
                EveSrfLanded = The vibrations, though slight, might be enough to map the interior structure of the planet. 
                EveSrfLanded =  A strange echoing effect is apparent. It could be a sign of underground cavities buried deep beneath the surface.
                GillySrfLanded = Gilly seems to be seismically as dead as a doorknob.
                GillySrfLanded = You fear your vessel has altered Gilly's course.
                GillySrfLanded = So far, the only seismic readings are those caused by you bouncing off the walls of the cabin.
                GillySrfLanded = The moon is so small and dead that the only noteworthy reading you get is an echo of your own landing bouncing back from the far side.
                GillySrfLanded = There is no activity on this barren rock.
                GillySrfLanded = This area appears to be seismically dead.
                GillySrfLanded = The only vibrations we detect are coming from the landing craft. Vibrations do not travel well through the surface.
                MunSrfLanded = Nothing to worry about. Really!
                MunSrfLanded = The sensor has detected a minor quake in the surface!

                DunaSrfLanded = The seismograph barely responds. If this planet ever had seismic activity, it doesn't anymore.
                DunaSrfLanded = The instrument detects some very faint tremors.
                DunaSrfLanded = The readings indicate an iron core. This planet might have had a functioning geodynamo in the distant past.

                LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's surface stretches and flexes under the strain of tidal forces from Jool.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The sensor is detecting heavy seismic activity deep below the surface. Perhaps Laythe has previously undetected volcanic activity. Only time will tell.
                LaytheSrfLanded = You've set the craft right on top of a fault line! You find this both fascinating and absolutely terrifying.

                BopSrfLanded = The planet gives off steady quakes which grow in intensity as Vall passes; as it leaves, they settle down again. This would be expected if the other moons did the same.
                BopSrfLanded = How can it be that Bop is this rock-steady for such a small moon?
                BopSrfLanded = Among all the shakes and jitters, you notice a continual pulsing pattern. It makes you feel uneasy.

                PolSrfLanded = The sensor registers very weak vibrations, which could provide a clue as to why Pol is that crumbled up.
                PolSrfLanded = There seems to be a lot of seismic activity around Pol's poles.
                PolSrfLanded = Apart from the occasional kerbal falling down the cliff, there is nothing for the seismometer to detect.
                PolSrfLanded = The loose soil transits vibration differently than on other bodies.
                PolSrfLanded = Vibrations reflect off the jagged structures inside the moon.
                EelooSrfLanded = The planet seems as still and dead as a rock right now. A large, frozen, ice-covered rock.
                EelooSrfLanded = Eeloo is silent.
                EelooSrfLanded = Was that a small tremor, or did the planet just shiver?

                EelooSrfLanded = Darn it, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a geologist! How do I know if there's going to be an Eeloo quake?
                EelooSrfLanded = There's a slight quake every now and then, but not much noteworthy activity.

                LaytheSrfSplashed = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = After a series of rather nominal readings there is a massive quake that nearly breaks the instruments.   Either a spacecraft just attempted take-off or the scientists made another "discovery."
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The incredibly sensitive equipment detects footsteps of people in the VAB, and even Dilorf dropping a pitcher full of ice water. You decide that's not your problem right now.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The needle jumps and shakes violently; moments later, you hear a distant explosion. Looks like somebody let Bill into the cafeteria kitchen again.

                MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The scans indicate a large series of quakes incoming! Oh wait, your hand brushed the sensor. False alarm.

                MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = The permanently shaded areas in the corners of the craters have slightly less seismic activity than the rest of the Mun.
                MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder how long it would take an impact at the south pole to register at the north pole.

                JoolFlyingLow = All the atmospheric turbulence makes taking a reading nearly impossible. Whose idea was it to come here, again?

                MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The seismometer detects some minor quakes, and what sounds like bubbling. Perhaps these areas are resurfaced by occasional geological activity.
                MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = A large impact nearby sends shockwaves throughout the planet.  This is a perfect opportunity to map the interior!
                MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = A boulder rolling down the neighboring slope interferes with your readings.
                MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = There's a lot of static on the sensor feed.  Are we sliding down the hill?
                DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The seismic scan picks up some vibrations as gas vents from the ice cap underneath.
                DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The scan detects some activity, probably associated with melting of the polar cap.

                Bop = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.
                BopInSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
                BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here…
                BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location… wait, it’s gone now. 
                PolInSpace = The sensor picks up multiple layers under the surface of the planet.
                PolSrfLanded = There are roughly twice as many left-handed negative graviolis as right-handed ones here. That means something. Nobody knows what, though.
                PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol.
                EelooInSpace = Before you left Kerbin, the program director told you of the great gravity of your mission. It is clear to you now that he exaggerated. 
                EelooInSpace = Though the surface appears to be smooth, there are fluctuations coming from beneath it.
                EelooSrfLanded = This planetoid has a small but significant gravitational force, perfect for extreme snowball fights.
                EelooSrfLanded = Gravity scans are very clear here. There is little influence from other bodies.
                IkeSrfLanded = Gravity scanner reports a low reading, very similar to that of the Mun. Do all moons have the same gravity? R&D notes the theory down, but they use a pencil just in case.
                IkeSrfLanded = Gravity is very low!
                IkeSrfLanded = You detect fluctuations in Duna’s tidal effect as it librates in the distance. 
                SunInSpaceLow = The gravitational pull is very high. Maybe that's why the planets don't fly away?
                SunInSpaceLow = The manufacturer's manual for this instrument has classified readings in this range as "very unwise". There is a somewhat unhelpful footnote that the warranty does not cover melting. 
                SunInSpaceLow = The readings are so far off the scale that the dial loops back around to 1.
                EveFlyingLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.
                JoolInSpaceHigh = The science team is going to get to write that "Large things in space produce large numbers" paper after all. 
                JoolInSpaceHigh = Yup. It's big.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
                VallInSpaceHigh = You can feel some gravity already.
                MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope.  Why did we land here again?
                EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.
                BopSrfLandedPoles = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
                MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.
                MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
                MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.
                MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.
                MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.
                MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.
                KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in.  What a surprise!
                GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner can't decide which way is up.
                GillyInSpaceLow = The display reads "Error HL3". Upon consultation with the manual, you discover that this means the sensor can't find any gravity to scan.
                GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner decides that the ship has more gravity than Gilly.

	RESULTS
	{ 
	default = You look at the results and understand that you have no idea what these numbers mean.
                default = A note is taped to the side of the instrument: "Does not measure fear."
                default = The sensors detect trace amounts of the installing technician's sandwich. 
                default = You run an Atmosphere Analysis, recording various measurements like temperature, pressure, and atmosphere composition.
                default = You’d like to run an atmospheric analysis, but all you can smell is the cheese from your snack last night. So you just push buttons and hope something valuable, or cheesy, will come of it.
                default = Aaron Kerman was best known for his heroic final efforts in discovering that the Mun has no atmosphere. Now we use these sensors instead.
                Mun = After a brief analysis you conclude that the lack of data is very likely related to the local atmosphere's void-like composition.
                default = Yep. Works as specified.
                MohoSrfLanded = There appears to be no atmosphere here. However, there are trace elements being detected close to the surface.
                MohoSrfLanded = Having expected a thin, melting-hot atmosphere around Moho, you can’t help but wonder what those pesky science fiction writers were thinking.
                MohoSrfLanded = Nary a breeze.
                EveSrfLanded = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
                EveSrfLanded = As you analyze the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
                EveSrfLanded = Extensive analysis reveals that Eve's atmosphere is not, in fact, grape flavored.
                EveSrfLanded = Though this is an atmosphere, it's definitely not something you want to breathe. 
                EveSrfLanded = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
                EveSrfLanded = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.
                EveSrfLanded = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors. 
                EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that purple is a weird colour.
                EveFlyingHigh = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Mission controls insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.
                EveFlyingHigh = The highly corrosive gasses start pocking and stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.
                EveFlyingHigh = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not the grape flavored air you were hoping for.
                EveFlyingHigh = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.
                EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of superheated water vapor.
                GillySrfLanded = You make several analyzes and expect different results each time. Nope, still no atmosphere. 
                GillySrfLanded = There is no detectable atmosphere.
                GillySrfLanded = People who thought there might be an atmosphere around Gilly should be banned from doing science forever.
                GillySrfLanded = You wonder why you brought the sensor here.
                KerbinFlyingHigh = Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Apparently, the atmosphere is made of ash and rocket fuel. But that might be because you're on the launchpad.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = I think a fly just got in the research equipment... don't tell the scientists!
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The extremely expensive array of sensors, samplers, and detectors has confirmed that today is a very good day to go to space. Which is nice, considering we already have the rocket out and everything.
                KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The sensor detects an explosive atmosphere. Try getting off the launchpad.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
                KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
                KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you’d expect from a thriving space program.
                KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid, and seems to have a bit of a fishy smell to it.
                KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The humidity readings are off the charts!  Open the hatch and check the sensor. Or not.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Sensors indicate a sudden decrease in ambient temperature and an increase in surrounding density.
                KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You tap the sensor a few times, but it only spits sparks. Somebody should’ve told you it could only analyze air.
                KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There’s lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
                KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There’s a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
                KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well.  The goat one peak over is shivering
                KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito divebombing it.  Apparently it’s carrying mal aria.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
                KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
                KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The sensors report that the air is cold but otherwise nominal.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere is very, very cold indeed. Some of the sensors have frozen shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air.
                KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It’s a tiny bit nippy here.
                MunSrfLanded = You didn't even stop to think about the lack of atmosphere here before installing this sensor did you?
                MunSrfLanded = The analysis shows not even a trace of air. You decide to see how long you can hold your breath, just in case.
                MunSrfLanded = Instruments detect a faint particulate aura around the surface. Not an atmosphere, but it may explain the reported lights on the horizon.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Atmospheric analysis indicates there is no atmosphere to analyze.
                MinmusSrfLanded = Atmospheric analysis identifies no harmful gasses in the current environment.  In fact, it identifies no gasses in the current environment at all.
                MinmusSrfLanded = While there may be some vaguely minty traces, Minmus has no real atmosphere.
                MinmusSrfLanded = There are detectable gas emissions. But nothing that could be considered an atmosphere.
                Duna = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
                DunaSrfLanded = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
                DunaSrfLanded = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
                DunaSrfLanded = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapour change with the seasons.
                DunaSrfLanded = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer say the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
                DunaSrfLanded = The carbon dioxide in the air is thick enough that it could be harvested for plants in greenhouses. Wait, what?
                DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
                DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Duna is very, very thin. It might be possible to fly in it with large enough wings or a fast enough aircraft.
                DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be a larger concentration of heavy isotopes in the atmosphere than on Kerbin.
                DunaSrfLanded = 255. Definitely 255.
                IkeSrfLanded = Either there's no atmosphere or the sensor is broken. Better not take your helmets off here, just in case.
                IkeSrfLanded = You run an analysis on the non-existent atmosphere.
                IkeSrfLanded = There is a faint aura of particles just like that of the Mün, but it can’t be called an atmosphere.
                DresSrfLanded = You hope that mission control sent you to somewhere with an atmosphere. You are disappointed and make a note to bring this up next time you speak to them.
                DresSrfLanded = There does not appear to be an atmosphere here.
                DresSrfLanded = It’s an airless world.
                DresSrfLanded = The scan reveals an atmosphere just like Kerbin’s... then you find a tiny hole above the scanner. Well, some bubble gum should fix that.
                Jool = The atmosphere seems to consist mostly of hydrogen and chlorine.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The sensors detect high concentrations of chlorine and helium. You are fascinated, but suspect your findings will cause some headaches for planetary scientists back on Kerbin.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis reveals unexpectedly high concentrations of molecular chlorine. You try not to think about what this corrosive gas might be doing to the spacecraft.
                JoolFlyingHigh = Microscopic diamonds, tossed up from liquid carbon far below, are detected in the scanner.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The Joolian clouds contain the expected hydrogen and helium, with substantial amounts of chlorine present.
                JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium-3 with traces of chlorine. Don't breathe it!
                JoolFlyingHigh = The atmospheric pressures are very high here and you detect a large number of gasses.
                JoolFlyingLow = It's so incredibly dense.
                JoolFlyingLow = Engineers scramble to adjust calculations to account for the new, very large crack in the instrument casing.
                JoolFlyingLow = The drag and pressure almost shut down the science machinery. The main report reads "Pressure Warning: Gain altitude immediately."
                JoolFlyingLow = The computer running the atmosphere analysis tool crashed. That's probably not good. Upon return, you plan to have a word with the engineers who designed this computer. 
                JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere here is made of little but hydrogen and helium.
                JoolFlyingLow = "Do you smell that? That smelly smell... it smells... smelly..."
                JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be very thick here.
                JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere is getting much denser now. However, it appears to be unusually transparent.
                JoolFlyingLow = Don't be silly.
                JoolFlyingLow = The Chlorine content is extremely high here, explaining how the planet got its distinctive green colour.
                JoolFlyingLow = The instrument is having trouble sampling at these densities.
                JoolFlyingLow = The instrument housing is starting to buckle under the immense pressure.
                LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!
                LaytheSrfLanded = There's definitely some oxygen in the atmosphere, but not much. Hypoxia would set in after only a few minutes without a respirator.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.
                LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. You shouldn't volunteer to go out first without a helmet on however.
                LaytheSrfLanded = Breathing this probably wouldn’t kill you... immediately.
                VallSrfLanded = There are traces of cryovolcanic compounds. But not a full atmosphere.
                TyloSrfLanded = There appears to be only faint traces of the heaviest isotopes on the surface.
                BopSrfLanded = The sensors detected organic compounds for a second. Possibly a mistake.
                BopSrfLanded = The sensors detect nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing lives here. Promise.
                BopSrfLanded = Despite the lack of an atmosphere, sensors indicate… sushi?
                PolSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere to speak of. But you sample the temperature anyways.
                PolSrfLanded = You detect a dense atmosphere of solid metallic oxides. Oh... wait... it’s just dust.
                EelooSrfLanded = The only atmosphere here seems to be lying around in frozen lumps.
                EelooSrfLanded = A lot of energy was expended to bring an atmospheric package all the way out here for nothing.
                EelooSrfLanded = The dust from landing is tricking the sensor into thinking there's an atmosphere here.
                DunaFlyingLow = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear iron oxide dust from the sensors.
                DunaFlyingLow = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
                DunaFlyingLow = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into… *ahem.*
                DunaFlyingLow = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
                DunaFlyingLow = Much of the atmosphere is dust that's blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.
                DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
                EveFlyingLow = The air is very dense here... and purple as well. You wonder why that is.
                EveFlyingLow = Why is the interior of the instrument turning purple?
                EveFlyingLow = Still no indication as to why it's all so purple!
                EveFlyingLow = The thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
                EveFlyingLow = To your surprise, the atmosphere contains a previously unknown compound that absorbs all but blue and red light.
                EveFlyingLow = Thick purpleness clogs the sensor.
                EveFlyingLow = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.
                EveFlyingLow = It's thick, purple, and full of hot air. What did you expect?
                LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be made up of oxygen and nitrogen. You wonder at the high chlorine content, though.
                LaytheFlyingLow = There's Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and lots of water. You scribble down a note: "Invest in colonization program."
                LaytheFlyingLow = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
                LaytheFlyingLow = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photodissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
                LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is not, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.
                EelooInSpace = If there is an atmosphere, it's almost undetectable -- likely from the cryogenic volcanoes spewing stuff everywhere.
                LaytheSrfSplashed = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
                MunInSpaceLow = Despite what some say, the Mun does not feature an atmosphere.
                SunInSpaceLow = Kerbol is emitting mostly helium and hydrogen, with trace elements occasionally blipping the screen. Perhaps a party supply store or blimp company would want to mine it?
                DunaFlyingHigh = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in. 
                DunaFlyingHigh = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
                DunaFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also higher.
                EveSrfSplashed = You feel relieved that you have plenty of oxygen left in your tanks, wherever they are.
                EveSrfSplashed = Acidic vapors are eating away at the sensor.
                KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much dryer over the desert.
